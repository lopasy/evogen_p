&lt;p&gt;The Academic framework enables you to easily create a beautifully simple personal or academic website using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily manage your homepage, blog posts, publications, talks, and projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurable widgets available for Biography, Publications, Projects, News/Blog, Talks, and Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a different section? Just use the Custom widget!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write in &lt;a href=&#34;/post/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for easy formatting and code highlighting, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; for mathematical expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social/academic network linking, &lt;a href=&#34;https://analytics.google.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive and mobile friendly&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/#installing-hugo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Install Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and create a new website by typing the following commands in your &lt;em&gt;Terminal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Command Prompt&lt;/em&gt; app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new site my_website
cd my_website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install Academic with &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic.git themes/academic
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or alternatively, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/archive/master.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download Academic&lt;/a&gt; and extract it into a &lt;code&gt;themes/academic&lt;/code&gt; folder within your Hugo website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are creating a new website, copy the contents of the &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt; folder to your website root folder, overwriting existing files if necessary. The &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt; folder contains an example config file and content to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start the Hugo server from your website root folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;localhost:1313&lt;/a&gt; and your new Academic powered website should appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customize your website - refer to the &lt;em&gt;Getting Started&lt;/em&gt; section below&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build your site by running the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command. Then &lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;host it for free using Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Or alternatively, copy the generated &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory (by FTP, Rsync, etc.) to your production web server (such as your university&amp;rsquo;s hosting service).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming you created a new website with the example content following the installation steps above, this section explores just a few more steps in order to customize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-parameters&#34;&gt;Core parameters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core parameters for the website can be edited in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; to your website URL (we recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com/create-your-website-with-hugo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; for free hosting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; to your desired website title such as your name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The example Disqus commenting variable should be cleared (e.g. &lt;code&gt;disqusShortname = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) or set to your own &lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; shortname to enable commenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit your details under &lt;code&gt;[params]&lt;/code&gt;; these will be displayed mainly in the homepage &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;contact&lt;/em&gt; widgets (if used). To disable a contact field, simply clear the value to &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place a square cropped portrait photo named &lt;code&gt;portrait.jpg&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder, overwriting any defaults. Note that you can edit the &lt;code&gt;avatar&lt;/code&gt; filepath to point to a different image name or clear the value to disable the avatar feature. Alternatively, set &lt;code&gt;gravatar&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; to use the Gravatar/Wordpress avatar associated with your &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt; address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enable LaTeX math for your site, set &lt;code&gt;math = true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social/academic networking links are defined as multiples of &lt;code&gt;[[params.social]]&lt;/code&gt;. They can be created or deleted as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduce-yourself&#34;&gt;Introduce yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit your biography in the &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; widget &lt;code&gt;content/home/about.md&lt;/code&gt; that you copied across from the &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/exampleSite/&lt;/code&gt; folder. The research interests and qualifications are stored as &lt;code&gt;interests&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;education&lt;/code&gt; variables. The academic qualifications are defined as multiples of &lt;code&gt;[[education.courses]]&lt;/code&gt; and can be created or deleted as necessary. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to completely hide the interests and education lists by deleting their respective variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;customize-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Customize the homepage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to our guide on using &lt;a href=&#34;/post/widgets/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;widgets&lt;/a&gt; to customize your homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-your-content&#34;&gt;Add your content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to our guide on &lt;a href=&#34;/post/managing-content/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;managing content&lt;/a&gt; to create your own publications, blog posts, talks, and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;remove-unused-widgets-and-pages&#34;&gt;Remove unused widgets and pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/post/managing-content/#removing-content&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;How to remove unused widgets and content pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;themes&#34;&gt;Themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following color themes are available and can be set by the &lt;code&gt;color_theme&lt;/code&gt; option in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;ocean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/images/theme-default.png&#34; alt=&#34;default theme&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/images/theme-ocean.png&#34; alt=&#34;ocean theme&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;forest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;code&gt;coffee&lt;/code&gt;  + &lt;code&gt;playfair&lt;/code&gt; font&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/images/theme-forest.png&#34; alt=&#34;forest theme&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/images/theme-coffee-playfair.png&#34; alt=&#34;coffee theme&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following font styles are available and can be set by the &lt;code&gt;font&lt;/code&gt; option in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;default (modern)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;classic (original Academic v1 style)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;playfair (serif)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;customization-updating&#34;&gt;Customization &amp;amp; updating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue reading below for advanced customization tips and instructions for keeping the framework up-to-date with any improvements that become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advanced-customization&#34;&gt;Advanced customization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to carry out many customizations without touching any files in &lt;code&gt;themes/academic&lt;/code&gt;, making it easier to update the framework in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigation-menu&#34;&gt;Navigation menu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; entries towards the bottom of &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; define the navigation links at the top of the website. They can be added or removed as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a dropdown sub-menu, add &lt;code&gt;identifier = &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the parent item and &lt;code&gt;parent = &amp;quot;something&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the child item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;website-icon&#34;&gt;Website icon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your main icon and mobile icon as square PNG images named &lt;code&gt;icon.png&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apple-touch-icon.png&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Place them in your root &lt;code&gt;static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;analytics&#34;&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/analytics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, add your tracking code in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; similarly to &lt;code&gt;googleAnalytics = &amp;quot;UA-12345678-9&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;third-party-and-local-scripts-js&#34;&gt;Third party and local scripts (JS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a third party script, create a file named &lt;code&gt;head_custom.html&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;layouts/partials/&lt;/code&gt; folder at the root of your website (not in the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; folder). Any HTML code added to this file will be included within your website&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s suitable for adding custom metadata or third party scripts specified with the &lt;em&gt;async&lt;/em&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas for your own local scripts, you can link your local JS assets (relative to your root &lt;code&gt;static/js&lt;/code&gt;) from your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;custom_js  = [&amp;quot;custom.js&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;language-and-translation&#34;&gt;Language and translation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interface text (e.g. buttons) is stored in language files which are collected from Academic&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/i18n/&lt;/code&gt; folder, as well as an &lt;code&gt;i18n/&lt;/code&gt; folder at the root of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To edit the interface text, copy &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/i18n/en.yaml&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;i18n/en.yaml&lt;/code&gt; (relative to the root of your website). Open the new file and make any desired changes to the text appearing after &lt;code&gt;translation:&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the language files are formatted in YAML syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To translate the interface text to another language, follow the above instructions, but name the new file in the form &lt;code&gt;i18n/X.yaml&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is the appropriate &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ISO/RFC5646 language identifier&lt;/a&gt; for the translation. Then follow the brief instructions in the &lt;em&gt;Language&lt;/em&gt; section at the bottom of your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. To change the default language used by Academic, set &lt;code&gt;defaultContentLanguage&lt;/code&gt; to the desired language identifier in your configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To translate the navigation bar, you can edit the default &lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; instances in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. However, for a multilingual site, you will need to duplicate all of the &lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; instances and rename the new instances from &lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;[[Languages.X.menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is the language identifier (e.g. &lt;code&gt;[[Languages.zh.menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; for Simplified Chinese). Thus, the navigation bar can be displayed in multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To translate a content file in your &lt;code&gt;content/&lt;/code&gt; folder into another language, copy the file to &lt;code&gt;filename.X.md&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is your existing filename and &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is the appropriate &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ISO/RFC5646 language identifier&lt;/a&gt; for the translation. Then translate the content in the new file to the specified language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further details on Hugo&amp;rsquo;s internationalization and multilingual features, refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content/multilingual/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;associated Hugo documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;permalinks&#34;&gt;Permalinks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Permalinks&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;permanent links&lt;/em&gt;, are URLs to individual pages and posts on your website. They are permanent web addresses which can be used to link to your content. Using Hugo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;permalinks&lt;/em&gt; option these can be easily customized. For example, the blog post URL can be changed to the form &lt;em&gt;yourURL/2016/05/01/my-post-slug&lt;/em&gt; by adding the following near the top of your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; (before &lt;code&gt;[params]&lt;/code&gt; settings):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[permalinks]
    post = &amp;quot;/:year/:month/:day/:slug&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;:slug&lt;/code&gt; defaults to the filename of the post, excluding the file extension. However, slug may be overridden on a per post basis if desired, simply by setting &lt;code&gt;slug = &amp;quot;my-short-post-title&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in your post preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:&lt;/strong&gt; let&amp;rsquo;s consider changing the URL path of posts from &lt;code&gt;post/&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;blog/&lt;/code&gt;. First, add the following parameters right above the &lt;code&gt;[params]&lt;/code&gt; section of your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[permalinks]
    post = &amp;quot;/blog/:slug&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then add &lt;code&gt;aliases = [&amp;quot;/blog/&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; to your post archive page &lt;code&gt;post/_index.md&lt;/code&gt; so that it can be accessed from the &lt;em&gt;/blog/&lt;/em&gt; URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;advanced-style-customization-css&#34;&gt;Advanced style customization (CSS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For advanced customization of the style, you can link custom CSS assets (relative to your root &lt;code&gt;static/css&lt;/code&gt;) from your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;custom_css = [&amp;quot;custom.css&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let&amp;rsquo;s override some of Academic&amp;rsquo;s default styles. First, define &lt;code&gt;custom_css = [&amp;quot;override.css&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. Then we can create the file &lt;code&gt;static/css/override.css&lt;/code&gt;, relative to your website root (i.e. &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory). Add your custom CSS to this file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating&#34;&gt;Updating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt; the project on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; to help keep track of updates and check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/tags/updates&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; prior to updating your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before updating the framework, it is recommended to make a backup of your entire website directory, or at least your &lt;code&gt;themes/academic&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before updating for the first time, the remote &lt;em&gt;origin&lt;/em&gt; repository should be renamed to &lt;em&gt;upstream&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd themes/academic
$ git remote rename origin upstream
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To list available updates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd themes/academic
$ git fetch upstream
$ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate HEAD..upstream/master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, update by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git pull upstream
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have modified files in &lt;code&gt;themes/academic&lt;/code&gt;, git will attempt to auto-merge changes. If conflicts are reported, you will need to manually edit the files with conflicts and add them back (&lt;code&gt;git add &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any issues after updating, you may wish to compare your site with the latest &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;example site&lt;/a&gt; to check if any settings changed in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; frontmatter of content files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback-contributing&#34;&gt;Feedback &amp;amp; Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; to let me know about any bugs or feature requests, or alternatively make a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For general questions about Hugo, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo discussion forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Customizing the homepage with widgets</title>
      <link>/post/widgets/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/widgets/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Homepage widgets display as sections on the homepage. They can be enabled/disabled and configured as desired. Academic has the following widgets available to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About/biography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected publications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent publications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent news/blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hero (introduction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom widget (demonstrated with the &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example site that you copied to create your site uses all the different types of widget (except talks), so you can generally just delete the widgets you don&amp;rsquo;t need and customize the parameters of the widgets you wish to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters for each widget vary. They can be found in the preamble/frontmatter (between the pair of &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;) for each widget installed in the &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By default, publications will be displayed in a simple list. If you prefer a more detailed list with abstract and image, you can enable the detailed publication list on the homepage by setting &lt;code&gt;list_format = 2&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;content/home/publications.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-a-widget-to-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Add a widget to the homepage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a widget manually, copy the relevant widget from &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/exampleSite/content/home/&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widget identifiers are set to their respective filenames, so a &lt;code&gt;content/home/about.md&lt;/code&gt; widget can be linked from the navigation bar by setting the relevant URL as &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;#about&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you want to use multiple instances of a widget, each widget will be assigned a unique ID based on the filename that you set. You can then use that ID for linking, like in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-the-custom-widget&#34;&gt;Using the custom widget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the custom widget to create your own home page sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply duplicate (copy/paste) and rename the example &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; file at &lt;code&gt;content/home/teaching.md&lt;/code&gt;. Then edit the section title, weight (refer to &lt;em&gt;Ordering sections&lt;/em&gt; below), and content as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also wish to add a navigation link to the top of the page that points to the new section. This can be achieved by adding something similar to the following lines to your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, where the URL will consist of the first title word in lowercase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]
    name = &amp;quot;Research&amp;quot;
    url = &amp;quot;#research&amp;quot;
    weight = 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remove-a-widget-from-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Remove a widget from the homepage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not require a particular widget, you can simply delete any associated files from the &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove a navigation link from the top of the page, remove the associated &lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; entry in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-widgets&#34;&gt;Ordering widgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order that the homepage widgets are displayed in is defined by the &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; parameter in each of the files in the &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; directory. The widgets are displayed in ascending order of their &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt;, so you can simply edit the &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; parameters as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing content</title>
      <link>/post/managing-content/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/managing-content/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a brief guide to managing content with the Academic framework. Content can include publications, projects, talks, news/blog articles, and widget pages. After you have read this guide about creating and managing content, you may also be interested to learn about &lt;a href=&#34;/post/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;writing content with Markdown, LaTeX, and Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable LaTeX math rendering for a page, you should include &lt;code&gt;math = true&lt;/code&gt; in the page&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble, as demonstrated in the included example site. Otherwise, to enable math on the homepage or for all pages, you must globally set &lt;code&gt;math = true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable source code highlighting by default for all pages, set &lt;code&gt;highlight = false&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. You can then enable source code highlighting only on pages that need it by setting &lt;code&gt;highlight = true&lt;/code&gt; in that page&amp;rsquo;s preamble. See the &lt;a href=&#34;/post/writing-markdown-latex/#code-highlighting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code-highlighting docs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To display a featured image in content page headers, the parameters below can be inserted towards the end of a page&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble. It is assumed that the image is located in your &lt;code&gt;static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder, so the full path in the example below will be &lt;code&gt;static/img/headers/getting-started.png&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to write an image caption or credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;[header]
image = &amp;quot;headers/getting-started.png&amp;quot;
caption = &amp;quot;Image credit: [**Academic**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/)&amp;quot;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you wish to prevent a featured image automatically being used for a post&amp;rsquo;s thumbnail on the homepage, the &lt;code&gt;preview = false&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be added to &lt;code&gt;[header]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;nav id=&#34;TableOfContents&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#create-a-publication&#34;&gt;Create a publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#create-a-blog-post&#34;&gt;Create a blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#create-a-project&#34;&gt;Create a project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#create-a-talk&#34;&gt;Create a talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#create-a-widget-page&#34;&gt;Create a widget page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#create-other-pages-e-g-cv&#34;&gt;Create other pages (e.g. CV)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#manage-archive-pages&#34;&gt;Manage archive pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#removing-content&#34;&gt;Removing content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#view-your-updated-site&#34;&gt;View your updated site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#deploy-your-site&#34;&gt;Deploy your site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-publication&#34;&gt;Create a publication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new publication:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new publication/my-paper-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the default variables at the top of &lt;code&gt;content/publication/my-paper-name.md&lt;/code&gt; to include the details of your publication. The &lt;code&gt;url_&lt;/code&gt; variables are used to generate links associated with your publication, such as for viewing PDFs of papers. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+++
title = &amp;quot;A publication title, such as title of a paper&amp;quot;

# Date first published.
date = &amp;quot;2013-07-01&amp;quot;

# Authors. Comma separated list, e.g. `[&amp;quot;Bob Smith&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;David Jones&amp;quot;]`.
authors = [&amp;quot;First author&#39;s name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Second author&#39;s name&amp;quot;]

# Publication type.
# Legend:
# 0 = Uncategorized
# 1 = Conference proceedings
# 2 = Journal
# 3 = Work in progress
# 4 = Technical report
# 5 = Book
# 6 = Book chapter
publication_types = [&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;]

# Publication name and optional abbreviated version.
publication = &amp;quot;In *International Conference on Academic*. You may use *Markdown* for italics etc.&amp;quot;
publication_short = &amp;quot;In *ICA*&amp;quot;

# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = &amp;quot;The abstract. Markdown and math can be used (note that math may require escaping as detailed in the red alert box below).&amp;quot;
abstract_short = &amp;quot;A short version of the abstract.&amp;quot;

# Featured image thumbnail (optional)
image_preview = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

# Is this a selected publication? (true/false)
selected = true

# Projects (optional).
#   Associate this publication with one or more of your projects.
#   Simply enter the filename (excluding &#39;.md&#39;) of your project file in `content/project/`.
#   E.g. `projects = [&amp;quot;deep-learning&amp;quot;]` references `content/project/deep-learning.md`.
projects = []

# Links (optional).
url_pdf = &amp;quot;pdf/my-paper-name.pdf&amp;quot;
url_preprint = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_code = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_dataset = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_project = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_slides = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_video = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_poster = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_source = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

# Custom links (optional).
#   Uncomment line below to enable. For multiple links, use the form `[{...}, {...}, {...}]`.
# url_custom = [{name = &amp;quot;Custom Link&amp;quot;, url = &amp;quot;http://example.org&amp;quot;}]

# Does the content use math formatting?
math = true

# Does the content use source code highlighting?
highlight = true

# Featured image
# Place your image in the `static/img/` folder and reference its filename below, e.g. `image = &amp;quot;example.jpg&amp;quot;`.
[header]
image = &amp;quot;headers/bubbles-wide.jpg&amp;quot;
caption = &amp;quot;My caption 😄&amp;quot;

+++

Further details on your publication can be written here using *Markdown* for formatting. This text will be displayed on the Publication Detail page.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;url_&lt;/code&gt; links can either point to local or web content. Associated local publication content, such as PDFs, may be copied to a &lt;code&gt;static/pdf/&lt;/code&gt; folder and referenced like &lt;code&gt;url_pdf = &amp;quot;pdf/my-paper-name.pdf&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also associate custom link buttons with the publication by adding the following block within the variable preamble above, which is denoted by &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;url_custom = [{name = &amp;quot;Custom Link 1&amp;quot;, url = &amp;quot;http://example.org&amp;quot;},
              {name = &amp;quot;Custom Link 2&amp;quot;, url = &amp;quot;http://example.org&amp;quot;}]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you set &lt;code&gt;list_format=2&lt;/code&gt; to enable a detailed listing of publications in the Publication Widget (&lt;code&gt;home/publications.md&lt;/code&gt;) or Publication Archive (&lt;code&gt;publication/_index.md&lt;/code&gt;), then there are a few more optional variables that you can include in the publication page preamble. You may use &lt;code&gt;abstract_short = &amp;quot;friendly summary of abstract&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;publication_short = &amp;quot;abbreviated publication details&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to display a friendly summary of the abstract and abbreviate the publication details, respectively. Furthermore, there is the option to display a different image on the homepage to the publication detail page by setting &lt;code&gt;image_preview = &amp;quot;my-image.jpg&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. This can be useful if you wish to scale down the image for the homepage or simply if you just wish to show a different image for the preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Any double quotes (&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) or backslashes (e.g. LaTeX &lt;code&gt;\times&lt;/code&gt;) occurring within the value of any frontmatter parameter (such as the &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;) should be escaped with a backslash (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;). For example, the symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and LaTeX text &lt;code&gt;\times&lt;/code&gt; become &lt;code&gt;\&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\\times&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#user-content-string&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TOML documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-blog-post&#34;&gt;Create a blog post&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a blog/news article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new post/my-article-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the newly created file &lt;code&gt;content/post/my-article-name.md&lt;/code&gt; with your full title and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo will automatically generate summaries of posts that appear on the homepage. If you are dissatisfied with an automated summary, you can either limit the summary length by appropriately placing &lt;code&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#33;&amp;#45;&amp;#45;more&amp;#45;&amp;#45;&amp;#62;&lt;/code&gt; in the article body, or completely override the automated summary by adding a &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble such that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary = &amp;quot;Summary of my post.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable commenting for a specific post, you can add &lt;code&gt;disable_comments = true&lt;/code&gt; to the post &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble. Or to disable commenting for all posts, you can either set &lt;code&gt;disqusShortname = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;disable_comments = true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-project&#34;&gt;Create a project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new project/my-project-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the newly created file &lt;code&gt;content/project/my-project-name.md&lt;/code&gt;. Either you can link the project to an external project website by setting the &lt;code&gt;external_link = &amp;quot;http://external-project.com&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; variable at the top of the file, or you can add content (below the final &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;) in order to render a project page on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-talk&#34;&gt;Create a talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new talk/my-talk-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the newly created file &lt;code&gt;content/talk/my-talk-name.md&lt;/code&gt; with your full talk title and details. Note that many of the talk parameters are similar to the publication parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-widget-page&#34;&gt;Create a widget page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you would like to create a page which utilizes Academic&amp;rsquo;s widget system, similar to the homepage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new folder in your &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; folder, naming it with your new page name. In this example, we will create a &lt;em&gt;courses&lt;/em&gt; page by creating a &lt;code&gt;content/courses/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within your new &lt;code&gt;content/courses/&lt;/code&gt; folder, create a file named &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt; containing the following parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+++
title = &amp;quot;Courses&amp;quot;
date = 2017-01-01
widgets = true
+++
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install widgets into your &lt;code&gt;content/courses/&lt;/code&gt; folder. To achieve this, widgets can be copied from your &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder or downloaded from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/content/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-other-pages-e-g-cv&#34;&gt;Create other pages (e.g. CV)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other types of content, it is possible to create your own custom pages. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s create a &lt;code&gt;cv.md&lt;/code&gt; page for your Curriculum Vitae in your &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; folder. Copy across the frontmatter from the top of one of your post files, adapting it as necessary, and editing your Markdown content below. You can then link to your new page by adding the code &lt;code&gt;[My CV]{{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;cv.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; to any of your existing content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, for the above example, we could use a PDF of your Curriculum Vitae. For this purpose, create a folder called &lt;code&gt;files&lt;/code&gt; within your &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; folder and move a PDF file named &lt;code&gt;cv.pdf&lt;/code&gt; to that location, so we have a &lt;code&gt;static/files/cv.pdf&lt;/code&gt; file path. The PDF can then be linked to from any content by using the code: &lt;code&gt;{{% staticref &amp;quot;files/cv.pdf&amp;quot; %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;manage-archive-pages&#34;&gt;Manage archive pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The archive (or &lt;em&gt;node index&lt;/em&gt;) pages (e.g. &lt;code&gt;/post/&lt;/code&gt;) are the special pages which list all of your content. They can exist for blog posts, publications, and talks. The homepage widgets will automatically link to the archive pages when you have more items of content than can be displayed in the widget. Therefore, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have much content, you may not see the automatic links yet - but you can also manually link to them using a normal Markdown formatted link in your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can edit the title and add your own content, such as an introduction, by copying the following content &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt; files from the example site to the same structure within your &lt;code&gt;content/&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/themes/academic/exampleSite/content/post/_index.md
/themes/academic/exampleSite/content/publication/_index.md
/themes/academic/exampleSite/content/talk/_index.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; parameter in each &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt; as desired and add any content after the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble/frontmatter ends. You will notice that the &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt; files differ slightly, with some having special options available for the associated content type. For example, &lt;code&gt;publication/_index.md&lt;/code&gt; contains an option for setting the citation style of the listings which appear on the publication archive page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;removing-content&#34;&gt;Removing content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, to remove content, simply delete the relevant file from your &lt;code&gt;content/post&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;content/publication&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;content/project&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;content/talk&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;view-your-updated-site&#34;&gt;View your updated site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have made changes to your site, you can view it by running the &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt; command and then opening &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;localhost:1313&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-your-site&#34;&gt;Deploy your site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can build the static website to a &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder ready for deployment using the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may then deploy your site by copying the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory (by FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Rsync, git push, etc.) to your production web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that running &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; does not remove any previously generated files before building. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s best practice to delete your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory prior to running &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to ensure no old or interim files are deployed to your server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/nav&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;sub-headings&#34;&gt;Sub-headings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emphasis&#34;&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Italics with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Bold with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough with ~~two tildes~~.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordered-lists&#34;&gt;Ordered lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. First item
2. Another item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unordered-lists&#34;&gt;Unordered lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* First item
* Another item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;images&#34;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images may be added to a page by placing them in your &lt;code&gt;static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder and referencing them using one of the following two notations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![alternative text for search engines](/img/screenshot.png)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A numbered figure with caption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;quot;/img/screenshot.png&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Figure Caption&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[I&#39;m a link](https://www.google.com)
[A post]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;post/hi.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
[A publication]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;publication/hi.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
[A project]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;project/hi.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
[Another section]({{&amp;lt; relref &amp;quot;hi.md#who&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable linking to a file, such as a PDF, first place the file in your &lt;code&gt;static/files/&lt;/code&gt; folder and then link to it using the following form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{% staticref &amp;quot;files/cv.pdf&amp;quot; &amp;quot;newtab&amp;quot; %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optional &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;newtab&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; argument for &lt;code&gt;staticref&lt;/code&gt; will cause the link to be opened in a new tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emojis&#34;&gt;Emojis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emoji cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; for available emoticons. The following serves as an example, but you should remove the spaces between each emoji name and pair of semicolons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I : heart : Academic : smile :
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ❤️ Academic 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockquote&#34;&gt;Blockquote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; This is a blockquote.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I have more [^1] to say.

[^1]: Footnote example.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have more &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-highlighting&#34;&gt;Code highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pass the &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; of the code, such as &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, as a parameter after three backticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
# Example of code highlighting
input_string_var = input(&amp;quot;Enter some data: &amp;quot;)
print(&amp;quot;You entered: {}&amp;quot;.format(input_string_var))
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Example of code highlighting
input_string_var = input(&amp;quot;Enter some data: &amp;quot;)
print(&amp;quot;You entered: {}&amp;quot;.format(input_string_var))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlighting-options&#34;&gt;Highlighting options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Academic theme uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highlight.js&lt;/a&gt; for source code highlighting, and highlighting is enabled by default for all pages. However, several configuration options are supported that allow finer-grained control over highlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table lists the supported options for configuring highlight.js, along with their expected type and a short description. A &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;strong&gt;config.toml&lt;/strong&gt; column means the value can be set globally in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, and a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;strong&gt;preamble&lt;/strong&gt; column means that the value can be set locally in a particular page&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;option&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;config.toml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;preamble&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;enable/disable highlighting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;slice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;choose additional languages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;choose a highlighting style&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt; option allows enabling or disabling the inclusion of highlight.js, either globally or for a particular page. If the option is unset, it has the same effect as if you had specified &lt;code&gt;highlight = true&lt;/code&gt;. That is, the highlight.js javascript and css files will be included in every page. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to only include highlight.js files on pages that actually require source code highlighting, you can set &lt;code&gt;highlight = false&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, and then override it by setting &lt;code&gt;highlight = true&lt;/code&gt; in the preamble of any pages that require source code highlighting. Conversely, you could enable highlighting globally, and disable it locally for pages that do not require it. Here is a table that shows whether highlighting will be enabled for a page, based on the values of &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt; set in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; and/or the page&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;config.toml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;page preamble&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;highlighting enabled for page?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight-languages&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; option allows you to specify additional languages that are supported by highlight.js, but are not considered &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; and therefore are not supported by default. For example, if you want source code highlighting for Go and clojure in all pages, set &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages = [&amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;clojure&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. If, on the other hand, you want to enable a language only for a specific page, you can set &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; in that page&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; options specified in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; and in a page&amp;rsquo;s preamble are additive. That is, if &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; contains, &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages = [&amp;quot;go&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; and the page&amp;rsquo;s preamble contains &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages = [&amp;quot;ocaml&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;, then javascript files for &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; go and ocaml will be included for that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; option is set, then the corresponding javascript files will be served from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;. To see a list of available languages, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs page&lt;/a&gt; and search for links with the word &amp;ldquo;languages&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; option provides an easy and convenient way to include support for additional languages to be severed from a CDN. If serving unmodified files from cdnjs doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet your needs, you can include javascript files for additional language support via one of the methods described in the &lt;a href=&#34;/post/getting-started/#third-party-and-local-scripts-js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight-style&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option allows you to select an alternate css style for highlighted code. For example, if you wanted to use the solarized-dark style, you could set &lt;code&gt;highlight_style = &amp;quot;solarized-dark&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option is unset, the default is to use the file &lt;code&gt;/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt;, either the one provided by the Academic theme, or else the one in your local &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directory.  The &lt;code&gt;/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt; file provided by Academic is equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; style from highlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; set, then &lt;code&gt;/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt; is ignored, and the corresponding css file will be served from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;. To see a list of available styles, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs page&lt;/a&gt; and search for links with the word &amp;ldquo;styles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highlight.js demo page&lt;/a&gt; for examples of available styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all styles listed on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highlight.js demo page&lt;/a&gt; are available from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to use a style that is not served by cdnjs, just leave &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; unset, and place the corresponding css file in &lt;code&gt;/static/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to change the default style that ships with Academic but you do want the style file served from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;highlight_style = &amp;quot;github&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option is only recognized when set in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. Setting &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; in your page&amp;rsquo;s preamble has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;Twitter tweet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To include a single tweet, pass the tweet’s ID from the tweet&amp;rsquo;s URL as parameter to the shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; tweet 666616452582129664 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;youtube&#34;&gt;Youtube&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vimeo&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; vimeo 146022717 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-gist&#34;&gt;GitHub gist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; gist USERNAME GIST-ID  &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;speaker-deck&#34;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; speakerdeck 4e8126e72d853c0060001f97 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rm-latex-math&#34;&gt;$\rm \LaTeX$ math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-TeX&#34;&gt;$$\left [ – \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V \right ] \Psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\left [ – \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V \right ] \Psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, inline math can be written by wrapping the formula with only a single &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is inline: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is inline: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that Markdown special characters need to be escaped with a backslash so they are treated as math rather than Markdown. For example, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; become &lt;code&gt;\*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\_&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;multiline-equations&#34;&gt;Multiline equations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard LaTeX line break consisting of 2 backslashes needs to be replaced with 6 backslashes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-TeX&#34;&gt;$$f(k;p\_0^\*) = \begin{cases} p\_0^\* &amp;amp; \text{if }k=1, \\\\\\
1-p\_0^\* &amp;amp; \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$f(k;p_0^*) = \begin{cases} p_0^* &amp;amp; \text{if }k=1, \\&lt;br /&gt;
1-p_0^* &amp;amp; \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;publication-abstracts&#34;&gt;Publication abstracts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Hugo and Academic attempt to parse TOML, Markdown, and LaTeX content in the abstract, the following guidelines should be followed just for the publication &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;abstract_short&lt;/code&gt; fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;escape each LaTeX backslash (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;) with an extra backslash, yielding &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;escape each LaTeX underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) with two backslashes, yielding &lt;code&gt;\\_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, &lt;code&gt;abstract = &amp;quot;${O(d_{\max})}$&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;abstract = &amp;quot;${O(d\\_{\\max})}$&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;table&#34;&gt;Table&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Markdown&#34;&gt;| Command           | Description                    |
| ------------------| ------------------------------ |
| `hugo`            | Build your website.            |
| `hugo serve -w`   | View your website.             |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Build your website.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo serve -w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;View your website.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;alerts&#34;&gt;Alerts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alerts are a useful feature that add side content such as tips, notes, or warnings to your articles. They are especially handy when writing educational tutorial-style articles. Use the corresponding shortcodes to enable alerts inside your content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{% alert note %}}
Here&#39;s a tip or note...
{{% /alert %}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will display the following &lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip or note&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{% alert warning %}}
Here&#39;s some important information...
{{% /alert %}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will display the following &lt;em&gt;warning&lt;/em&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some important information&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-of-contents&#34;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A table of contents may be particularly useful for long posts or tutorial/documentation type content. Use the &lt;code&gt;{{% toc %}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode anywhere you wish within your Markdown content to automatically generate a table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Footnote example.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Common questions and answers will be listed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I cloned/downloaded Academic but Hugo produces errors when using it with my existing Hugo site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic is a website &lt;em&gt;framework&lt;/em&gt; rather than just a &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, you must follow the full installation guide found on the Demo/Documentation website or in the Github Readme. If you still have problems, first try running Hugo on the Academic Example Site found in the &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/exampleSite&lt;/code&gt; folder and then compare the configuration parameters in the Example Site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; and content files with the files in your existing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosting your site with Netlify or Cloudflare and experience strange behavior such as filters not working?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disable post-processing steps such as &lt;em&gt;minification&lt;/em&gt; in your Netlify/Cloudflare admin panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publications and other content are not sorted by newest first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo/TOML require that the value for the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; field should be in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#local-date-time&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TOML format&lt;/a&gt;, as per frontmatter of the &lt;code&gt;content/publication/&lt;/code&gt; files in the example site. If you want to use a partial date, such as year, you should still complete a full date to make a valid TOML date format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue parsing LaTeX in publication abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the following LaTeX which fails to parse correctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;abstract = &amp;quot;${O(d_{\max})}$&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a side effect of Academic and Hugo attempting to parse TOML, Markdown and LaTeX content in the abstract. The solution is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;escape each LaTeX backslash (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;) with an extra backslash, yielding &lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;escape each LaTeX underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) with two backslashes, yielding &lt;code&gt;\\_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, editing the above example, we get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;abstract = &amp;quot;${O(d\\_{\\max})}$&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannot achieve line break in multiline equation (LaTeX/Mathjax)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt; usually achieves a line break in a multiline LaTeX/Mathjax equation, but due to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Markdown parser it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solution: use 6 backslashes for a line break, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$$\begin{eqnarray} 
y &amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 1+1   \\\\\\
&amp;amp;=&amp;amp; 2
\end{eqnarray}$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll to Hugo</title>
      <link>/post/migrate-from-jekyll/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips for migrating an existing website from Jekyll to Hugo. These tips can be applied in conjunction with following Hugo Academic&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;/post/getting-started/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;getting started guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;move-static-content-to-static&#34;&gt;Move static content to &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; will be copied as-is to the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; output. Hugo keeps all static content under &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;. You should therefore move it all there.
With Jekyll, something that looked like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/
    ▾ images/
        logo.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should become&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/
    ▾ static/
        ▾ images/
            logo.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;) to be moved to &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fix-content&#34;&gt;Fix content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the amount of customization that was done for each post in Jekyll, this step will require more or less effort. There are no hard and fast rules here except that &lt;code&gt;hugo server --watch&lt;/code&gt; and the Hugo Academic example site are your friends. Test your changes and fix errors as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;publish&#34;&gt;Publish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default is for Jekyll to publish the website to a &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory, whereas Hugo publishes to a &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-practical-example&#34;&gt;A practical example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Normand migrated his website from Jekyll to Hugo in less than a day. You can see all his changes by looking at this GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexandre-normand/alexandre-normand/compare/869d69435bd2665c3fbf5b5c78d4c22759d7613a...b7f6605b1265e83b4b81495423294208cc74d610&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;diff&lt;/a&gt;. However, bear in mind that this example is &lt;strong&gt;not specific to the Academic theme nor does it use the latest version of Hugo&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investigation of gene-environment and gene-gene interaction effects is a natural extension to genome-wide analysis. Given the fact that both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to contribute to development of myopia, the goal of the PhD was to look at the interplay between the two factors to discover novel gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. In Chapter 1 I give an introduction to myopia, focusing on definition, classification, world-wide prevalence, current treatment methods and causes. Chapter 2 introduces reader with the theory of interactions. A detailed description on methods for interaction investigation is given. Chapter 3 outlines analysis of GxE and Chapter 4 is dedicated to GxG. Finally, Chapter 5 provides a conclusion and implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;description-of-the-uk-biobank-cohort&#34;&gt;Description of the UK Biobank cohort&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., 2015) recruited approximately 500,000 individuals, mostly aged 37 to 73 years old. The information collected included questionnaire-responses about education, lifestyle choices, family history, and diet. At a baseline visit to an assessment centre (of which there were 22 distributed across the UK) participants provided biological samples such as blood and saliva, and underwent a range of cognitive and physical measurements. Approximately 23% of UK Biobank participants underwent an ophthalmic assessment. Refractive error was assessed successfully in 107,452 participants, while age-at-onset of spectacle/contact lens wear was ascertained for 465,050 participants. DNA samples from all the participants were genotyped, using one of two SNP array platforms (N = 438,427 for UK Biobank Axiom and N = 49,950 for UK BiLEVE), phased using SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al., 2013) and imputed to a combined 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (The Genomes Project, 2015) (N=2,504 individuals) and UK10K (Huang et al., 2015) (N=6,285 individuals) reference panels. A detailed description of the official UK Biobank genotyping and quality control methods can be accessed from &lt;a href=&#34;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/genotyping_qc.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/genotyping_qc.pdf&lt;/a&gt; and information regarding haplotype estimation and imputation can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/impute_ukb_v1.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/impute_ukb_v1.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (both links accessed 29 on April 2016). In total, 805,426 SNPs have been directly genotyped and used for imputation, which resulted in over 92 million SNPs available for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-introduction-to-myopia&#34;&gt;1.    Introduction to myopia&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##1.1.  Definition and classification
Myopia (short-sightedness or near-sightedness) is a type of refractive error of the eye and is amongst the most common eye disorders in the world. The WHO recognises myopia as a major cause of visual impairment [Resnikoff et al., 2004]. In healthy patients with clear vision, distant objects are focused on or near photoreceptors, whereas in myopic eyes the image of distant objects falls in front of the photoreceptors [Morgan et al., 2012]. The resulting blurred image cannot be brought into focus by accommodation (the variable power of the lens) causing visual impairment. The primary cause of myopia is disproportionate elongation of the posterior segment of the eye [Wojciechowski, 2011]. This eye length and myopia relationship allows researchers to use axial length measurement as an endophenotype for understanding the biology behind myopia [axial length GWAS]. Although important biologically, refractive error is the clinically meaningful value [Morgan et al., 2012]. On rare occasions, it can result as a consequence of abnormal changes in corneal curvature [].
Refractive error is quantified as spherical equivalent (SE; spherical refraction plus half the negative cylinder) in diopters (D) [Morgan et al., 2012] and theoretically can range from minus infinity to plus infinity, although in practice the spread is much narrower [see Cook and Glasscock, 1951]. By convention (in most cases?), individuals with SE ???+0.5D are defined as hyperopic, those with SE +0.25D and ???0.25D as emmetropic and myopic if refractive error is ??????0.5D. &amp;ldquo;Most children are born hyperopic, with a normal distribution of refractive errors. During the first year or two after birth, the distribution narrows, with a mean in the hyperopic range of +1-2 dioptres (D). This change indicates that there is an active process shaping the distribution of refraction, known as emmetropisation&amp;rdquo; [Morgan et al., 2012]. Having said that, there still remains some ambiguity as to what is the best way to classify myopia. It has been classified by aetiology (simple, hereditary, degenerative), age of onset (juvenile-onset, adult-onset), severity (low, medium, high) and with or without degenerative changes (physiological, pathological), but no well-accepted, well-defined classification of myopia exists []. For example, to define high myopia or pathological myopia thresholds range from ???-5D to -10D [Morgan et al., 2102]. Individuals with -6 refractive error or below are most often considered to be highly myopic and these individuals have increased risk to develop other eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma and chorioretinal abnormalities [Saw et al., 2005].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##1.2.  Prevalence distribution
There is unambiguous consensus that the rates of myopia prevalence have increased rapidly over the last few decades, with the most extreme cases seen in East Asian populations [Morgan et al., 2012]. The pattern that emerges from epidemiological studies suggest large variation in prevalence rates in different ethnicities and age groups. It can range from as low as 5% in Australian Aborigines to as high as 84% in Hong Kong and Taiwan [Jobke et al., 2008].
Though the human eye undergoes rapid growth during early childhood&amp;ndash;increasing in length from approximately 18 mm at birth to 22-23 mm at three years of age&amp;ndash;the variability of refractive error decreases progressively during this period [in Wojciechowski, 2011]. Because the eye grows throughout childhood, myopia generally develops in school-age children and adolescents. About 2% of children aged 5-6 are myopic [Mutti et al., 1996]. Sex differences in whites and East Asians emerge at about 9 years and by late adolescence girls are twice as likely to become myopic (OR 2.03, 95% Credible Interval 1.40-2.93 for whites and OR 2.30, 95% Credible Interval 2.01-2.61 for East Asians) [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. It is estimated that the eye grows 0.5 mm between 10-18 years [Fledelius, 1982] and the incidence of myopia increases sevenfold during this time [Mutti et al., 1996]. Approximately 3-5% of 10-year old white Europeans are myopic [Williams et al., 2008] and up to 20% of 12-13 year olds [Logan et al., 2011]. High myopia affects 10-20% of secondary school children in East Asia [Lin et al., 2004; Morgan et al., 2012]. A meta-analysis by Rudnicka et al., 2016 investigated trends in prevalence of childhood myopia (age group 1-18 years) in 42 different countries. In total, they assessed 374,349 participants, 74,847 of which were considered to be myopic. Sufficient data was only available for whites, East Asians and South Asians. After accounting for age and environmental setting (urban, rural or combined), they observed increase in prevalence per decade only in East Asians (OR 1.23). No variation due to geographic location was observed. There was markedly higher risk of myopia in children from urban environments (OR 2.61, 95% Credible Interval 1.79-3.86). If stratified by country, in all cases but one (whites) an urban environment was associated with increased risk. The same study did not find any differences in myopia prevalence in studies from Europe, USA and Oceania. The highest prevalence was in 18-year old children from Singapore (92%) and about 87% in children from Hong Kong and Taiwan, 72% in China in the same age group. The lowest rates were observed for 5-year old children in rural Mongolia (0.3%) and in general lowest rates in Mongolians from rural areas for all age groups compared to countries analysed were lowest. An interesting observation was made for South Asian migrant children residing in Australia, England or Singapore. They were five times more likely to become myopic than their counterparts living in Nepal or India. At 15 years of age approximately 40% of migrant South Asians are myopic compared with 9% of indigenous South Asians. This supports the notation that migrant refractive error adjusts for new environment []. Data on children of Middle Eastern origin are less comprehensive than data of children of European, south Asian, or east Asian ancestry [Morgan et al., 2012]. In general, the prevalences of myopia are low, but urban-rural differences exist.
With current prevalence rates, what can we infer about the future of myopia? Estimates for year 2025 suggest 324 million individuals will be myopic (95% Credible Interval 276-382 million) [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Others estimate that by 2050. Rapid economic expansion has possibly contributed the most towards myopia increase in East and South Asians and this region is likely to remain the epicentre of myopia increase. This also suggests it is important to monitor trends in other regions expected to experience rapid development [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Overall, the prevalence of myopia seems to depend on where children grow up and the environments to which they are exposed, rather than aspects of genetic ancestry [Morgan et al., 2012].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##1.3.  Treatment-ish
Currently, there is no strategy to completely stop myopia progression, but multiple tools exist to correct refractive error. These can be split into those used to slow down myopia progression or those applied to prevent myopia onset and include lenses, spectacles and refractive surgery. Refractive surgery, in which the corneal surface is flattened and its optical power reduced is now also routine, but is generally not recommended until refractive development has stabilised in the twenties [Morgan et al., 2012].
In addition, evidence suggests that time spent outdoor and time spent performing near-work influence myopia progression. Therefore, some proposed using different correction strategies such as spend more time in schools, or build glass rooms etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##1.4.  Causes
Myopia is considered to be a multifactorial disorder influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Epidemiological observations suggest refraction changes throughout life. Corneal curvature appears to remain relatively stable after age 6, and therefore does not play an important role in juvenile and adult-onset myopia [Zadnik et al., 2003]. Instead, human myopia is largely the result of age-dependent increase in ocular axial length [Fledelius, 1982; Zadnik et al., 2004].
Fifty years ago, myopia was believed to be genetic, with only minor environmental influences [Sorsby, 1962] but throughout the years, there has been a rapid shift towards supporting mostly environmental basis for myopia development and progression. One of the clearest insights supporting this idea comes from studies that investigated the relationship between education attainment and myopia. It has been consistently shown that individuals who spend more time in education tend to have more negative refractive error [Au Eong et al., 1993; Shimizu et al., 2003]. Highly correlated factors with education such as socio-economic status (SES), intelligence and near-work are also associated with myopia [Saw et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2002]. Higher SES, increased time reading, and higher IQ have been demonstrated to be associated with myopes. Why? Some researches pointed out that myopia prevalence in some African populations is very low [Jimenez et al., 2012] and this could be attributed to low literacy rates, as most children in investigated countries do not start formal education until ages of 6-8 years. On the other hand, East Asian populations have alarmingly high prevalence rates that could be at least partially explained by strong educational pressures from an early age []. Additional confounding factor is likely to be steady rise in the use of modern electronic devices over the past three decades [Wojciechovski, 2011]. In a cross-sectional investigation of 12 year-old Australian school children, Ip et al. found no significant relationships between myopia and time spent in near work. However, they showed significant associations of myopia with close reading distance and sustained, continuous, reading [Ip et al., 2008]. Studies on the effect of reading on the rate of progression of myopia have provided conflicting results. In a study of Singapore school children, near work was not associated with worsening myopia [Saw et al., 2000]. On the other hand, myopic children in Finland who spent more time reading had faster rates of myopia progression [Parssinen et al., 1989]. Collectively, this favours strong environmental influence on refractive error development.
As discussed before, urbanization is also indicative of refractive error status [Uzma et al., 2009; Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Potential explanations include a more congested environment [Ip et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010] and greater emphasis on education and hence near vision activities [He et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2015]. Children from urban environments have 2.6 times the odds of myopia compared with those from rural environments [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Despite the association between myopia prevalence and an urban environment, ethnic differences in myopia prevalence exist among populations drawn from the same living environment [].
Studies with tree shrew, chick and macaque monkey eyes involving some sort of form-deprivation demonstrated unconstrained eye growth [Sherman et al., 1977; Wallman et al., 1978; Wiesel and Raviola, 1977] and studies with optical defocus via plus-or minus-powered lenses included detectable compensatory changes in eye growth [Graham and Judge, 1999]. This demonstrated that changes in environment could alter normal growth of the eye. Animal studies typically use eyes from early stage of development and whether the results can be extrapolated to adolescent and mature animals remains to be answered [Wojciechowski, 2011 - is it to date?].
More time spent outdoors have been shown to have a positive effect []. Physical activity undertaken whilst outside seems to be unimportant. Moreover, the beneficial effect of outdoor activity appears not to be the result of a concomitant reduction in near work [Wojciechowski, 2011]. Several theories have been proposed to explain protective mechanism (Vitamin D, dopamine levels, circadian genes). Some studies suggest Vitamin D plays a crucial role [], while others suggest it is unimportant []. However, some researchers challenge the idea that light is the only factor and propose greater viewing distance as another contributor (Ian Flitcroft, Dublin).
One meta-analysis of three British birth cohort studies including over 15,000 white children showed that various familial factors were related to the odds of reduced vision (a proxy for myopia) in childhood including social class, parental education, maternal age and birth order (with higher risk among first-born children) [Rudnicka et al., 2008].
High prevalences and progression rates of myopia have been observed in individuals in visually intensive occupations such as clinical microscopists [McBrien and Adams, 1997], carpet weavers [Simensen and Thorud, 1994] and visual display terminal workers [Tokor, 1988].
Smoking
Plenty of evidence of genetic contribution towards development and progression of myopia exist. Heritability estimates from twin studies across populations are consistently high [Hammond et al., 2001; Wojciechowski et al., 2005], although as with any other trait, the estimates are confounded by shared environment and non-additive effects.
As a side effect, myopia develops in syndromic refractive errors with known genetic predisposition [Westling et al., 1998].
The number of myopic parents has also been associated [Jones et al., 2007; Saw et al., 2006] but relationship might be confounded with shared environmental effect [Wojciechowski, 2011].
Both linkage and association studies have reported numerous genes to be associated with myopia (probably not only).
Genes involved in eye size and refractive regulation have been identified with animal knock-out models [Chen et al., 2010; Schippert et al., 2007].
Studies with rare variants
Interactions to date
Searching for gene-environment or gene-gene interactions can be thought of as chasing for a subset of individuals among all those sampled, whom if exposed to particular environment or in presence of certain combination of genetic variants, would show different rates of myopia development and progression. Suppose we could identify individuals who in presence of myopigenic environmental exposure show low levels of decrease in avMSE. Having such information would be useful in making predictions and would therefore lead to more accurate phenotype estimation. Individuals that show high decrease or above average decrease would be advised to restrict exposure. In some cases, it might not be possible or not desirable [example? education]. In other cases, a solution might be fairly easy (see phenylketonuria). Furthermore, studying interactions could lead to discovery of new biological mechanisms which cause abnormal elongation in myopic eyes. For example, it could uncover a pathway that would be otherwise difficult to detect. This could stimulate research on developing treatment either through development of new drugs or by providing insight for conducting genome editing.  It is reasonable to assume that such knowledge would prove to be useful in personalized medicine, since it&amp;rsquo;s goal is to separate patients into different groups and provide tailored treatment to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease [&lt;a href=&#34;https://acmedsci.ac.uk/download?f=file&amp;amp;i=32644&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://acmedsci.ac.uk/download?f=file&amp;amp;i=32644&lt;/a&gt;]. Considering GxE and GxG should provide a better understanding of genetic architecture, i.e. what is the effect in presence of multiple factors. This could prove to be useful in studying correlated traits, for instance other refractive errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A natural extension to GWAS analysis is to incorporate interaction effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-2-methods-to-detect-gxe&#34;&gt;2.2. Methods to detect GxE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many new methods have been developed to study gene-environment interactions. The simplest type of tests includes exhaustive search methods that screen for interactions across the genome.  Tests for both case-control [] and quantitative [] phenotypes are available. It was shown that when there is gene-environment independence [], case-only test is much more powerful and guards against increased number of false positives if the assumption of independence is met. Some people have suggested to perform interaction analysis only in exposed subset of individuals [] or controls only [].
In most cases, it is unknown whether there exist gene-environment independence. To address this issue, empirical Bayes [] and Bayesian model averaging [] methods have been proposed.
A few joint methods have been developed. Kraft et al. proposed 2 degrees of freedom test of main G and GxE for all SNPs. Gauderman et al. later extended this method to include gene-environment correlation for all SNPs.
Next group of tests includes methods that test for GxE only on a subset of SNPs. These multistep tests are motivated by a screen for a subset of potentially interacting variants depending on the relationship between genetic variants, environment and phenotype.  For example, one of the first such tests was proposed by Murcray et al., where the first step screening is based on gene-environment correlation and only those variants that show some correlation are used to test for GxE using case-control analysis. Kooperberg and LeBlanc proposed screening on disease-gene association. Many case-control tests using screening strategy followed, including screening disease-gene association and using empirical Bayes to look for GxE [], screening based on joint test of E-G and D-G association to look for GxE in a case-control analysis [], screening based on E-G association with second stage 2 degree of freedom joint test to test for both G and GxE [], Cocktail analysis of GxE interaction []. A few 2-step methods have been developed to study quantitative phenotypes, including a screen based on Y-G association [], residual variance heterogeneity (rVar) [] and both Y-G association and rVar []. Unlike conventional methods that test for mean differences between genotype groups, the last two methods for GxE look at difference in variance between genotypes. Initially, this was proposed by Pare et al. in 2010 for Y-G association? but this was shown to be incorrect []. The correct way was described in the same paper by screening on residual variance heterogeneity.  In addition, 2 distinct approaches exist to prioritize SNPs for second stage testing:
-   Subset testing
Test only a subset m&amp;lt;&amp;lt; M SNPs that have p &amp;lt; ??_11 from the Step 1 screen, with Step 2 significance level ??/m (i.e. a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs that pass Step 1). Here the analyst must specify ??_1. A larger value of ??_1 will increase the chance of passing a DSL into Step 2, but at the cost of also increasing the number of unassociated SNPs that pass into Step 2. A lower value of ??_1 leads to lower m and thus greater power in Step 2, but at the potential cost of screening out a DSL. The optimal choice of ??_1 depends strongly on M but also on other underlying parameters (e.g. minor allele frequency of a DSL, exposure frequency, magnitude of an interaction, etc.). As a general rule, we have found that setting ??_1 so that between m=25 and m=200 SNPs pass into Step 2 is near optimal for many models. For example, if M=1 million, setting ??_1 to 0.0001 would yield approximately m=100 SNPs to be tested in Step 2.
-   Weighted hypothesis testing
Rather than restrict Step-2 testing to a subset of the SNPs, one can test all M SNPs using a weighted significance level in Step 2 based on the ordered p-values from Step 1 and an initial bin size B. Specifically, the B most significant (lowest p-value) SNPs based on Step 1 are evaluated in Step 2 at significance level (?? /2)/B, the next 2B SNPs are evaluated at (?? /4)/(2B), the next 4B at (?? /8)/(4B), etc. As shown by Ionita-Laza et al., 2007, this guarantees that the overall significance level for the entire procedure does not exceed ??. They recommended setting B to 5. When B=5 the top 5 SNPs from Step 1 are tested in Step 2 at significance level 0.005, the next 10 at 0.00125, etc. Note that with weighted testing the top SNPs from Step 1 are tested at a more liberal (less strict) significance threshold than the standard 5 x 10-8 level required in an exhaustive scan of all M SNPs using standard methods. However, the majority of SNPs will be tested at a significance level that is more stringent than 5x10-8. This indicates the importance of using an efficient Step-1 screening approach with strong likelihood of highly ranking any SNP with a true interaction. As an example, across many simulation scenarios for a disease outcome, we have found the Step-1 screen of the EDGxE method tends to rank true signals higher than the corresponding Step-1 screens of alternative two-step methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set-based tests
Other Bayesian methods
Non-parametric methods - multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR)
The MDR is a non-parametric model-free approach, designed to collapse high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension [Hanh et al., 2003]. The procedure of the algorithm can be described in 6 steps:
    As part of cross validation, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
    2. A set of genetic or environmental factors are selected.
The reduction is accomplished by pooling together genotypes to form a high risk or low risk groups. The performance of this new multilocus genotype is assessed by cross-validation and its significance is evaluated by permutation testing. This method can be used to test for both GxE and GxG. This method allows to investigate higher order interactions although as with any other method, computational demands increase dramatically. Because it is a non-parametric method, no hypothesis concerning the value of any statistical parameter is made and no genetic inheritance model is assumed. MDR has identified interactions in a variety of different real datasets, including sporadic breast cancer [9], essential hypertension [7], type 2 diabetes [10], atrial fibrillation [11], amyloid polyneuropathy [12] and coronary artery calcification [13]. No assumption about the independence or biological relevance of SNPs or any other factor are made, since MDR selects the combination of factors providing the most information.
Bizarre ones
There is also question on which scale should interactions be interpreted -  additive or multiplicative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the UK Biobank consortium released data for 488,377 genotyped individuals. Eight individuals who decided to withdraw their data have been removed. Data analyses were restricted to individuals of European ancestry who did not self-report the following eye disorders: cataracts, &amp;ldquo;serious eye problems&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;eye trauma&amp;rdquo;, or a history of cataract surgery, corneal graft surgery, laser eye surgery, or other eye surgery in the past 4 weeks. Individuals whose hospital records (ICD10 codes) indicated a history of the following were also excluded: cataract surgery, eye surgery, retinal surgery, or retinal detachment surgery. A total of 48,145 samples did not meet these criteria. The white-British subset was created by removing 69,938 individuals from different ancestries leaving 370,286 individuals for analysis. A total of 648 people were described as heterozygosity and missingness outliers by the UK Biobank consortium and so were removed. A total of 283,352 individuals were removed because refractive error was not measured by a doctor (obtain more details on how this was measured maybe). For some of the individuals (N = 240,125) with missing phenotype data, average mean spherical equivalent between the two eyes (avMSE) was predicted using age of spectacles wear information and fitting different age polynomial terms until the optimal number was found. Remaining 86,286 individuals have been tested for relatedness using plink version 1.9 (Chang et al, 2015) and one member of each pair of observed genomic relatedness greater than 0.025 was excluded. The genetic relationship matrix was created using LD-pruned set of well-imputed variants (with IMPUTE2 INFO metric &amp;gt; 0.9, MAF &amp;gt; 0.005, missing rate ??? 0.01, and &amp;lsquo;rs&amp;rsquo; variant ID prefix).  LD-pruning was accomplished by using &amp;ndash;indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1 command in PLINK version 2 (Chang et al, 2015). This resulted in 72,985 samples that passed quality control (about 15% of the total number of genotyped individuals). In this final subset, no individuals had mismatched inferred and self-reported sex. In some other analyses, the number of individuals included in the models differed slightly depending on how the environmental variable was coded (N = 72,536 when education was used to reflect the age of full time education completion and N = 71,973 was used to represent relative education). No SNPs were excluded based on imputation because variants with MAF &amp;gt; 5% were shown to have fairly high information score (Bycroft et al, 2017). Individuals with predicted MSE were tested for relatedness using the same cut-off value and 160,228 (33%) were retained (unrelated). Likewise, the number of individuals differed slightly (N = 159,158 when education was used to reflect the age of full time education completion and N = 158,761 was used to represent relative education).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;3-1-2-snp-quality-control&#34;&gt;3.1.2.    SNP quality control&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All analyses were restricted to genetic variants that had a missing genotype rate &amp;lt; 2% and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium &amp;gt; 10-6. Minor allele frequency was set to &amp;gt; 5%, except in the case of prediction were SNPs with MAF &amp;gt; 1% for better prediction. Only directly genotyped SNPs and those imputed using Haplotype Reference Consortium were considered. In total, about 4.7M SNPs passed quality control stage and were used to discover associations and interaction with true avMSE and predicted avMSE. About 8.5M SNPs were used for predicting MSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;3-1-3-education-as-environmental-variable&#34;&gt;3.1.3.    Education as environmental variable&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education was selected to be an environmental variable for testing gene-environment interactions because previous studies reported one of the strongest correlations between education and avMSE. Three distinct ways of coding education were considered:
1. Education based on whether an individual has university degree or not as stated by the UK Biobank (this variable was named UniEdu). Those with the degree were coded as 1 and those without as 0 in all analyses.
2. &amp;ldquo;When environmental variables are measured in a continuous scale, a clearer picture of the interaction can be assessed since the varying patterns of genetic effects responsive to environmental changes can be traced, leading to a better understanding of the genetic heterogeneity under different environmental stimuli (Cen et al, 2015)&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, the effect of education was assessed on a continuous scale (named as EduAgeOLD). Recoding was done based on the age at full time education completion, ranging from 13 to 26 years. For some individuals, this information was not available and in such case, university degree holders were assumed to have completed full time education at the age of 21 years. Individuals who did not have university degree were excluded. In total this resulted in 29,813 individuals assigned with 21 years.
3. The last method considered the shift towards greater education age and university attendance with increasing year-of-birth in UK Biobank. This could add to the difficulty of detecting a SNP x Education interaction (if the effects of education are relative rather than absolute). Hence, a new variable called EduYearsHigh was created. If an individual had an-above average level of education given their year-of-birth and sex, education was coded as 1 and 0 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;3-1-4-creating-predicted-mse&#34;&gt;3.1.4.    Creating predicted MSE&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple methods have been explored to predict average MSE for individuals without refractive error measurement:
1.  A prediction was made using age of onset of spectacles wear.
2.  Another method of prediction involved the use of LDpred software. This program calculates genetic risk score factoring Linkage Disequilibrium. A decision was made to include SNPs with 0.01 - 0.05 MAF range in order to achieve more accurate prediction. SNPs that had low imputation score (&amp;lt; 0.8) were also removed. This led to removal of 16,645 SNPs. Duplicate SNPs were removed (N = 238). By default, LDpred excludes markers with ambiguous effect directions, i.e., A/T and G/C SNPs. The quality control resulted in . SNPs for prediction and validation. Summary statistics were calculated using 71,973 individuals with available avMSE information.
3.  One of the strategies to predict avMSE was LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) from plink software. First, heritability was calculated to be 0.38 with GCTA-GREML method [].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;3-1-5-the-models-used-to-test-for-gxe&#34;&gt;3.1.5.    The models used to test for GxE&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following describes the models used to run main GWAS and GxE interaction. To account for population structure that exists between participants from different regions, in all cases first 10 principal components were used in a statistical model. The main genetic effects have been studied using the following linear regression model:
         ???????? = ???? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ????????                 (x)
where ???????? is the spherical equivalent refractive error of the ith participant, m is the population mean, ???????? is sex, ???????? is age, ???????? is university education, ???????? is genotyping platform array, ???????? is a vector of 10 principal components, ???????? is the allele dosage on the scale 0-2 for the test SNP and ???????? is the error term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;3-1-6-heritability-estimation&#34;&gt;3.1.6.   Heritability estimation&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After performing analyses with continuous average MSE, a decision was made to explore MSE from case-control viewpoint. Heritability analysis was performed to decide which case-control threshold should be used for performing interaction analysis. A selection was based on the amount of variance explained, standard errors and prevalence. If a particular threshold explained high proportion of variance but had large standard errors, a threshold with smaller standard errors was preferred. In general, higher variance and prevalence were assumed to give more accurate underlying genetic architecture. In addition, phenotype thresholds were selected based on observed liability scale. A range of thresholds were investigated, starting with 0 D and reaching -6 D with 0.25 D intervals. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML. For estimation, a random sample of 45,000 individuals with non-missing EduYearsHigh variable was selected. High confidence SNPs (LD-pruned set of variants with &amp;ndash;indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1, IMPUTE2 INFO metric &amp;gt; 0.9, MAF &amp;gt; 0.005, missing rate ??? 0.01, and &amp;lsquo;rs&amp;rsquo; variant ID prefix) were used to create a genetic relationship matrix for this subset of randomly sampled individuals. Ideally, disease prevalence should be specified using population prevalence but since this information for each threshold is not available, prevalence was specified using 71,973 UK Biobank individuals with EduYearsHigh information. Were needed, p-values were calculated as proposed in Lin, 1989?. As for other covariates, first 10 principal components and age were included as quantitative covariates, genotyping array and sex were included as discrete covariates. EduYearsHigh was included as environmental variable. Main effect was treated as fixed and the GxE interaction was treated as random effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;1-7-cross-validation-using-predicted-avmse&#34;&gt;.1.7. Cross-validation using predicted avMSE&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-stage methods have been shown to be more robust at detecting interactions on a genome-wide scale compared to standard linear or logistic regression that surveys all SNPs passing quality control. The problem is that the ideal second stage selection threshold is not defined in the literature. Stringent thresholds will miss GxE and GxG effects for SNPs that have very small main genetic effects. Setting the threshold to 0.05 or close to nominal p-value will lead to an increased number of false positive SNPs for interaction testing. To decide what threshold is the most suitable, 6-fold cross validation was performed. A sample of ~160K unrelated individuals with predicted averaged mean spherical equivalent between the two eyes data was randomly split into 6 groups, each with 26,700 individuals. For each group, a GWAS including a GxE interaction term was performed. The GxE results were meta-analysed 6 times, each time leaving one group out and the left-out group was used for replication. Inverse variance based meta-analysis was performed with METAL (Willer et al, 2010). Before determining how many SNPs replicate, SNPs passing a certain threshold were LD clumped. LD threshold for clumping was set to 0.1 and physical distance threshold for clumping was set to 1000kb. We reasoned that higher selection thresholds were unreliable because in some cases no SNP or just 1 SNP was remaining after LD clumping.  Using 1 replicated SNP to calculate FDR is inaccurate since FDR can change dramatically from 0 to 1. Therefore, a decision was made to select a threshold that gave mean FDR of 0.8, which corresponded to -log(p) = 5.45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of gene-environment and gene-gene interaction effects is a natural extension to genome-wide analysis. Given the fact that both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to contribute to development of myopia, the goal of the PhD was to look at the interplay between the two factors to discover novel gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. In Chapter 1 I give an introduction to myopia, focusing on definition, classification, world-wide prevalence, current treatment methods and causes. Chapter 2 introduces reader with the theory of interactions. A detailed description on methods for interaction investigation is given. Chapter 3 outlines analysis of GxE and Chapter 4 is dedicated to GxG. Finally, Chapter 5 provides a conclusion and implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Description of the UK Biobank cohort&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., 2015) recruited approximately 500,000 individuals, mostly aged 37 to 73 years old. The information collected included questionnaire-responses about education, lifestyle choices, family history, and diet. At a baseline visit to an assessment centre (of which there were 22 distributed across the UK) participants provided biological samples such as blood and saliva, and underwent a range of cognitive and physical measurements. Approximately 23% of UK Biobank participants underwent an ophthalmic assessment. Refractive error was assessed successfully in 107,452 participants, while age-at-onset of spectacle/contact lens wear was ascertained for 465,050 participants. DNA samples from all the participants were genotyped, using one of two SNP array platforms (N = 438,427 for UK Biobank Axiom and N = 49,950 for UK BiLEVE), phased using SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al., 2013) and imputed to a combined 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (The Genomes Project, 2015) (N=2,504 individuals) and UK10K (Huang et al., 2015) (N=6,285 individuals) reference panels. A detailed description of the official UK Biobank genotyping and quality control methods can be accessed from &lt;a href=&#34;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/genotyping_qc.pdf&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/genotyping_qc.pdf&lt;/a&gt; and information regarding haplotype estimation and imputation can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/impute_ukb_v1.pdf&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/impute_ukb_v1.pdf&lt;/a&gt; (both links accessed 29 on April 2016). In total, 805,426 SNPs have been directly genotyped and used for imputation, which resulted in over 92 million SNPs available for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;definition-and-classification&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.1. Definition and classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopia (short-sightedness or near-sightedness) is a type of refractive error of the eye and is amongst the most common eye disorders in the world. The WHO recognises myopia as a major cause of visual impairment [Resnikoff et al., 2004]. In healthy patients with clear vision, distant objects are focused on or near photoreceptors, whereas in myopic eyes the image of distant objects falls in front of the photoreceptors [Morgan et al., 2012]. The resulting blurred image cannot be brought into focus by accommodation (the variable power of the lens) causing visual impairment. The primary cause of myopia is disproportionate elongation of the posterior segment of the eye [Wojciechowski, 2011]. This eye length and myopia relationship allows researchers to use axial length measurement as an endophenotype for understanding the biology behind myopia [axial length GWAS]. Although important biologically, refractive error is the clinically meaningful value [Morgan et al., 2012]. On rare occasions, it can result as a consequence of abnormal changes in corneal curvature []. Refractive error is quantified as spherical equivalent (SE; spherical refraction plus half the negative cylinder) in diopters (D) [Morgan et al., 2012] and theoretically can range from minus infinity to plus infinity, although in practice the spread is much narrower [see Cook and Glasscock, 1951]. By convention (in most cases?), individuals with SE ???+0.5D are defined as hyperopic, those with SE +0.25D and ???0.25D as emmetropic and myopic if refractive error is ??????0.5D. “Most children are born hyperopic, with a normal distribution of refractive errors. During the first year or two after birth, the distribution narrows, with a mean in the hyperopic range of +1-2 dioptres (D). This change indicates that there is an active process shaping the distribution of refraction, known as emmetropisation” [Morgan et al., 2012]. Having said that, there still remains some ambiguity as to what is the best way to classify myopia. It has been classified by aetiology (simple, hereditary, degenerative), age of onset (juvenile-onset, adult-onset), severity (low, medium, high) and with or without degenerative changes (physiological, pathological), but no well-accepted, well-defined classification of myopia exists []. For example, to define high myopia or pathological myopia thresholds range from ???-5D to -10D [Morgan et al., 2102]. Individuals with -6 refractive error or below are most often considered to be highly myopic and these individuals have increased risk to develop other eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma and chorioretinal abnormalities [Saw et al., 2005].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;prevalence-distribution&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.2. Prevalence distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is unambiguous consensus that the rates of myopia prevalence have increased rapidly over the last few decades, with the most extreme cases seen in East Asian populations [Morgan et al., 2012]. The pattern that emerges from epidemiological studies suggest large variation in prevalence rates in different ethnicities and age groups. It can range from as low as 5% in Australian Aborigines to as high as 84% in Hong Kong and Taiwan [Jobke et al., 2008]. Though the human eye undergoes rapid growth during early childhood–increasing in length from approximately 18 mm at birth to 22-23 mm at three years of age–the variability of refractive error decreases progressively during this period [in Wojciechowski, 2011]. Because the eye grows throughout childhood, myopia generally develops in school-age children and adolescents. About 2% of children aged 5-6 are myopic [Mutti et al., 1996]. Sex differences in whites and East Asians emerge at about 9 years and by late adolescence girls are twice as likely to become myopic (OR 2.03, 95% Credible Interval 1.40-2.93 for whites and OR 2.30, 95% Credible Interval 2.01-2.61 for East Asians) [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. It is estimated that the eye grows 0.5 mm between 10-18 years [Fledelius, 1982] and the incidence of myopia increases sevenfold during this time [Mutti et al., 1996]. Approximately 3-5% of 10-year old white Europeans are myopic [Williams et al., 2008] and up to 20% of 12-13 year olds [Logan et al., 2011]. High myopia affects 10-20% of secondary school children in East Asia [Lin et al., 2004; Morgan et al., 2012]. A meta-analysis by Rudnicka et al., 2016 investigated trends in prevalence of childhood myopia (age group 1-18 years) in 42 different countries. In total, they assessed 374,349 participants, 74,847 of which were considered to be myopic. Sufficient data was only available for whites, East Asians and South Asians. After accounting for age and environmental setting (urban, rural or combined), they observed increase in prevalence per decade only in East Asians (OR 1.23). No variation due to geographic location was observed. There was markedly higher risk of myopia in children from urban environments (OR 2.61, 95% Credible Interval 1.79-3.86). If stratified by country, in all cases but one (whites) an urban environment was associated with increased risk. The same study did not find any differences in myopia prevalence in studies from Europe, USA and Oceania. The highest prevalence was in 18-year old children from Singapore (92%) and about 87% in children from Hong Kong and Taiwan, 72% in China in the same age group. The lowest rates were observed for 5-year old children in rural Mongolia (0.3%) and in general lowest rates in Mongolians from rural areas for all age groups compared to countries analysed were lowest. An interesting observation was made for South Asian migrant children residing in Australia, England or Singapore. They were five times more likely to become myopic than their counterparts living in Nepal or India. At 15 years of age approximately 40% of migrant South Asians are myopic compared with 9% of indigenous South Asians. This supports the notation that migrant refractive error adjusts for new environment []. Data on children of Middle Eastern origin are less comprehensive than data of children of European, south Asian, or east Asian ancestry [Morgan et al., 2012]. In general, the prevalences of myopia are low, but urban-rural differences exist. With current prevalence rates, what can we infer about the future of myopia? Estimates for year 2025 suggest 324 million individuals will be myopic (95% Credible Interval 276-382 million) [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Others estimate that by 2050. Rapid economic expansion has possibly contributed the most towards myopia increase in East and South Asians and this region is likely to remain the epicentre of myopia increase. This also suggests it is important to monitor trends in other regions expected to experience rapid development [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Overall, the prevalence of myopia seems to depend on where children grow up and the environments to which they are exposed, rather than aspects of genetic ancestry [Morgan et al., 2012].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;treatment-ish&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.3. Treatment-ish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no strategy to completely stop myopia progression, but multiple tools exist to correct refractive error. These can be split into those used to slow down myopia progression or those applied to prevent myopia onset and include lenses, spectacles and refractive surgery. Refractive surgery, in which the corneal surface is flattened and its optical power reduced is now also routine, but is generally not recommended until refractive development has stabilised in the twenties [Morgan et al., 2012]. In addition, evidence suggests that time spent outdoor and time spent performing near-work influence myopia progression. Therefore, some proposed using different correction strategies such as spend more time in schools, or build glass rooms etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;causes&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.4. Causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopia is considered to be a multifactorial disorder influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Epidemiological observations suggest refraction changes throughout life. Corneal curvature appears to remain relatively stable after age 6, and therefore does not play an important role in juvenile and adult-onset myopia [Zadnik et al., 2003]. Instead, human myopia is largely the result of age-dependent increase in ocular axial length [Fledelius, 1982; Zadnik et al., 2004]. Fifty years ago, myopia was believed to be genetic, with only minor environmental influences [Sorsby, 1962] but throughout the years, there has been a rapid shift towards supporting mostly environmental basis for myopia development and progression. One of the clearest insights supporting this idea comes from studies that investigated the relationship between education attainment and myopia. It has been consistently shown that individuals who spend more time in education tend to have more negative refractive error [Au Eong et al., 1993; Shimizu et al., 2003]. Highly correlated factors with education such as socio-economic status (SES), intelligence and near-work are also associated with myopia [Saw et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2002]. Higher SES, increased time reading, and higher IQ have been demonstrated to be associated with myopes. Why? Some researches pointed out that myopia prevalence in some African populations is very low [Jimenez et al., 2012] and this could be attributed to low literacy rates, as most children in investigated countries do not start formal education until ages of 6-8 years. On the other hand, East Asian populations have alarmingly high prevalence rates that could be at least partially explained by strong educational pressures from an early age []. Additional confounding factor is likely to be steady rise in the use of modern electronic devices over the past three decades [Wojciechovski, 2011]. In a cross-sectional investigation of 12 year-old Australian school children, Ip et al. found no significant relationships between myopia and time spent in near work. However, they showed significant associations of myopia with close reading distance and sustained, continuous, reading [Ip et al., 2008]. Studies on the effect of reading on the rate of progression of myopia have provided conflicting results. In a study of Singapore school children, near work was not associated with worsening myopia [Saw et al., 2000]. On the other hand, myopic children in Finland who spent more time reading had faster rates of myopia progression [Parssinen et al., 1989]. Collectively, this favours strong environmental influence on refractive error development. As discussed before, urbanization is also indicative of refractive error status [Uzma et al., 2009; Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Potential explanations include a more congested environment [Ip et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010] and greater emphasis on education and hence near vision activities [He et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2015]. Children from urban environments have 2.6 times the odds of myopia compared with those from rural environments [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Despite the association between myopia prevalence and an urban environment, ethnic differences in myopia prevalence exist among populations drawn from the same living environment []. Studies with tree shrew, chick and macaque monkey eyes involving some sort of form-deprivation demonstrated unconstrained eye growth [Sherman et al., 1977; Wallman et al., 1978; Wiesel and Raviola, 1977] and studies with optical defocus via plus-or minus-powered lenses included detectable compensatory changes in eye growth [Graham and Judge, 1999]. This demonstrated that changes in environment could alter normal growth of the eye. Animal studies typically use eyes from early stage of development and whether the results can be extrapolated to adolescent and mature animals remains to be answered [Wojciechowski, 2011 - is it to date?]. More time spent outdoors have been shown to have a positive effect []. Physical activity undertaken whilst outside seems to be unimportant. Moreover, the beneficial effect of outdoor activity appears not to be the result of a concomitant reduction in near work [Wojciechowski, 2011]. Several theories have been proposed to explain protective mechanism (Vitamin D, dopamine levels, circadian genes). Some studies suggest Vitamin D plays a crucial role [], while others suggest it is unimportant []. However, some researchers challenge the idea that light is the only factor and propose greater viewing distance as another contributor (Ian Flitcroft, Dublin). One meta-analysis of three British birth cohort studies including over 15,000 white children showed that various familial factors were related to the odds of reduced vision (a proxy for myopia) in childhood including social class, parental education, maternal age and birth order (with higher risk among first-born children) [Rudnicka et al., 2008]. High prevalences and progression rates of myopia have been observed in individuals in visually intensive occupations such as clinical microscopists [McBrien and Adams, 1997], carpet weavers [Simensen and Thorud, 1994] and visual display terminal workers [Tokor, 1988]. Smoking Plenty of evidence of genetic contribution towards development and progression of myopia exist. Heritability estimates from twin studies across populations are consistently high [Hammond et al., 2001; Wojciechowski et al., 2005], although as with any other trait, the estimates are confounded by shared environment and non-additive effects. As a side effect, myopia develops in syndromic refractive errors with known genetic predisposition [Westling et al., 1998]. The number of myopic parents has also been associated [Jones et al., 2007; Saw et al., 2006] but relationship might be confounded with shared environmental effect [Wojciechowski, 2011]. Both linkage and association studies have reported numerous genes to be associated with myopia (probably not only). Genes involved in eye size and refractive regulation have been identified with animal knock-out models [Chen et al., 2010; Schippert et al., 2007]. Studies with rare variants Interactions to date Searching for gene-environment or gene-gene interactions can be thought of as chasing for a subset of individuals among all those sampled, whom if exposed to particular environment or in presence of certain combination of genetic variants, would show different rates of myopia development and progression. Suppose we could identify individuals who in presence of myopigenic environmental exposure show low levels of decrease in avMSE. Having such information would be useful in making predictions and would therefore lead to more accurate phenotype estimation. Individuals that show high decrease or above average decrease would be advised to restrict exposure. In some cases, it might not be possible or not desirable [example? education]. In other cases, a solution might be fairly easy (see phenylketonuria). Furthermore, studying interactions could lead to discovery of new biological mechanisms which cause abnormal elongation in myopic eyes. For example, it could uncover a pathway that would be otherwise difficult to detect. This could stimulate research on developing treatment either through development of new drugs or by providing insight for conducting genome editing. It is reasonable to assume that such knowledge would prove to be useful in personalized medicine, since it’s goal is to separate patients into different groups and provide tailored treatment to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease [&lt;a href=&#34;https://acmedsci.ac.uk/download?f=file&amp;amp;i=32644&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://acmedsci.ac.uk/download?f=file&amp;amp;i=32644&lt;/a&gt;]. Considering GxE and GxG should provide a better understanding of genetic architecture, i.e. what is the effect in presence of multiple factors. This could prove to be useful in studying correlated traits, for instance other refractive errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2.2. Methods to detect GxE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many new methods have been developed to study gene-environment interactions. The simplest type of tests includes exhaustive search methods that screen for interactions across the genome. Tests for both case-control [] and quantitative [] phenotypes are available. It was shown that when there is gene-environment independence [], case-only test is much more powerful and guards against increased number of false positives if the assumption of independence is met. Some people have suggested to perform interaction analysis only in exposed subset of individuals [] or controls only []. In most cases, it is unknown whether there exist gene-environment independence. To address this issue, empirical Bayes [] and Bayesian model averaging [] methods have been proposed. A few joint methods have been developed. Kraft et al. proposed 2 degrees of freedom test of main G and GxE for all SNPs. Gauderman et al. later extended this method to include gene-environment correlation for all SNPs. Next group of tests includes methods that test for GxE only on a subset of SNPs. These multistep tests are motivated by a screen for a subset of potentially interacting variants depending on the relationship between genetic variants, environment and phenotype. For example, one of the first such tests was proposed by Murcray et al., where the first step screening is based on gene-environment correlation and only those variants that show some correlation are used to test for GxE using case-control analysis. Kooperberg and LeBlanc proposed screening on disease-gene association. Many case-control tests using screening strategy followed, including screening disease-gene association and using empirical Bayes to look for GxE [], screening based on joint test of E-G and D-G association to look for GxE in a case-control analysis [], screening based on E-G association with second stage 2 degree of freedom joint test to test for both G and GxE [], Cocktail analysis of GxE interaction []. A few 2-step methods have been developed to study quantitative phenotypes, including a screen based on Y-G association [], residual variance heterogeneity (rVar) [] and both Y-G association and rVar []. Unlike conventional methods that test for mean differences between genotype groups, the last two methods for GxE look at difference in variance between genotypes. Initially, this was proposed by Pare et al. in 2010 for Y-G association? but this was shown to be incorrect []. The correct way was described in the same paper by screening on residual variance heterogeneity. In addition, 2 distinct approaches exist to prioritize SNPs for second stage testing: - Subset testing Test only a subset m&amp;lt;&amp;lt; M SNPs that have p &amp;lt; ??_11 from the Step 1 screen, with Step 2 significance level ??/m (i.e. a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs that pass Step 1). Here the analyst must specify ??_1. A larger value of ??_1 will increase the chance of passing a DSL into Step 2, but at the cost of also increasing the number of unassociated SNPs that pass into Step 2. A lower value of ??_1 leads to lower m and thus greater power in Step 2, but at the potential cost of screening out a DSL. The optimal choice of ??_1 depends strongly on M but also on other underlying parameters (e.g. minor allele frequency of a DSL, exposure frequency, magnitude of an interaction, etc.). As a general rule, we have found that setting ??_1 so that between m=25 and m=200 SNPs pass into Step 2 is near optimal for many models. For example, if M=1 million, setting ??_1 to 0.0001 would yield approximately m=100 SNPs to be tested in Step 2. - Weighted hypothesis testing Rather than restrict Step-2 testing to a subset of the SNPs, one can test all M SNPs using a weighted significance level in Step 2 based on the ordered p-values from Step 1 and an initial bin size B. Specifically, the B most significant (lowest p-value) SNPs based on Step 1 are evaluated in Step 2 at significance level (?? /2)/B, the next 2B SNPs are evaluated at (?? /4)/(2B), the next 4B at (?? /8)/(4B), etc. As shown by Ionita-Laza et al., 2007, this guarantees that the overall significance level for the entire procedure does not exceed ??. They recommended setting B to 5. When B=5 the top 5 SNPs from Step 1 are tested in Step 2 at significance level 0.005, the next 10 at 0.00125, etc. Note that with weighted testing the top SNPs from Step 1 are tested at a more liberal (less strict) significance threshold than the standard 5 x 10-8 level required in an exhaustive scan of all M SNPs using standard methods. However, the majority of SNPs will be tested at a significance level that is more stringent than 5x10-8. This indicates the importance of using an efficient Step-1 screening approach with strong likelihood of highly ranking any SNP with a true interaction. As an example, across many simulation scenarios for a disease outcome, we have found the Step-1 screen of the EDGxE method tends to rank true signals higher than the corresponding Step-1 screens of alternative two-step methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set-based tests Other Bayesian methods Non-parametric methods - multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) The MDR is a non-parametric model-free approach, designed to collapse high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension [Hanh et al., 2003]. The procedure of the algorithm can be described in 6 steps: As part of cross validation, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. 2. A set of genetic or environmental factors are selected. The reduction is accomplished by pooling together genotypes to form a high risk or low risk groups. The performance of this new multilocus genotype is assessed by cross-validation and its significance is evaluated by permutation testing. This method can be used to test for both GxE and GxG. This method allows to investigate higher order interactions although as with any other method, computational demands increase dramatically. Because it is a non-parametric method, no hypothesis concerning the value of any statistical parameter is made and no genetic inheritance model is assumed. MDR has identified interactions in a variety of different real datasets, including sporadic breast cancer [9], essential hypertension [7], type 2 diabetes [10], atrial fibrillation [11], amyloid polyneuropathy [12] and coronary artery calcification [13]. No assumption about the independence or biological relevance of SNPs or any other factor are made, since MDR selects the combination of factors providing the most information. Bizarre ones There is also question on which scale should interactions be interpreted - additive or multiplicative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the UK Biobank consortium released data for 488,377 genotyped individuals. Eight individuals who decided to withdraw their data have been removed. Data analyses were restricted to individuals of European ancestry who did not self-report the following eye disorders: cataracts, “serious eye problems”, “eye trauma”, or a history of cataract surgery, corneal graft surgery, laser eye surgery, or other eye surgery in the past 4 weeks. Individuals whose hospital records (ICD10 codes) indicated a history of the following were also excluded: cataract surgery, eye surgery, retinal surgery, or retinal detachment surgery. A total of 48,145 samples did not meet these criteria. The white-British subset was created by removing 69,938 individuals from different ancestries leaving 370,286 individuals for analysis. A total of 648 people were described as heterozygosity and missingness outliers by the UK Biobank consortium and so were removed. A total of 283,352 individuals were removed because refractive error was not measured by a doctor (obtain more details on how this was measured maybe). For some of the individuals (N = 240,125) with missing phenotype data, average mean spherical equivalent between the two eyes (avMSE) was predicted using age of spectacles wear information and fitting different age polynomial terms until the optimal number was found. Remaining 86,286 individuals have been tested for relatedness using plink version 1.9 (Chang et al, 2015) and one member of each pair of observed genomic relatedness greater than 0.025 was excluded. The genetic relationship matrix was created using LD-pruned set of well-imputed variants (with IMPUTE2 INFO metric &amp;gt; 0.9, MAF &amp;gt; 0.005, missing rate ??? 0.01, and ‘rs’ variant ID prefix). LD-pruning was accomplished by using –indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1 command in PLINK version 2 (Chang et al, 2015). This resulted in 72,985 samples that passed quality control (about 15% of the total number of genotyped individuals). In this final subset, no individuals had mismatched inferred and self-reported sex. In some other analyses, the number of individuals included in the models differed slightly depending on how the environmental variable was coded (N = 72,536 when education was used to reflect the age of full time education completion and N = 71,973 was used to represent relative education). No SNPs were excluded based on imputation because variants with MAF &amp;gt; 5% were shown to have fairly high information score (Bycroft et al, 2017). Individuals with predicted MSE were tested for relatedness using the same cut-off value and 160,228 (33%) were retained (unrelated). Likewise, the number of individuals differed slightly (N = 159,158 when education was used to reflect the age of full time education completion and N = 158,761 was used to represent relative education).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;3.1.2. SNP quality control&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All analyses were restricted to genetic variants that had a missing genotype rate &amp;lt; 2% and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium &amp;gt; 10-6. Minor allele frequency was set to &amp;gt; 5%, except in the case of prediction were SNPs with MAF &amp;gt; 1% for better prediction. Only directly genotyped SNPs and those imputed using Haplotype Reference Consortium were considered. In total, about 4.7M SNPs passed quality control stage and were used to discover associations and interaction with true avMSE and predicted avMSE. About 8.5M SNPs were used for predicting MSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;education-as-environmental-variable&#34; class=&#34;section level5&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3.1.3. Education as environmental variable&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education was selected to be an environmental variable for testing gene-environment interactions because previous studies reported one of the strongest correlations between education and avMSE. Three distinct ways of coding education were considered: 1. Education based on whether an individual has university degree or not as stated by the UK Biobank (this variable was named UniEdu). Those with the degree were coded as 1 and those without as 0 in all analyses. 2. “When environmental variables are measured in a continuous scale, a clearer picture of the interaction can be assessed since the varying patterns of genetic effects responsive to environmental changes can be traced, leading to a better understanding of the genetic heterogeneity under different environmental stimuli (Cen et al, 2015)”. Therefore, the effect of education was assessed on a continuous scale (named as EduAgeOLD). Recoding was done based on the age at full time education completion, ranging from 13 to 26 years. For some individuals, this information was not available and in such case, university degree holders were assumed to have completed full time education at the age of 21 years. Individuals who did not have university degree were excluded. In total this resulted in 29,813 individuals assigned with 21 years. 3. The last method considered the shift towards greater education age and university attendance with increasing year-of-birth in UK Biobank. This could add to the difficulty of detecting a SNP x Education interaction (if the effects of education are relative rather than absolute). Hence, a new variable called EduYearsHigh was created. If an individual had an-above average level of education given their year-of-birth and sex, education was coded as 1 and 0 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;creating-predicted-mse&#34; class=&#34;section level5&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3.1.4. Creating predicted MSE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple methods have been explored to predict average MSE for individuals without refractive error measurement: 1. A prediction was made using age of onset of spectacles wear. 2. Another method of prediction involved the use of LDpred software. This program calculates genetic risk score factoring Linkage Disequilibrium. A decision was made to include SNPs with 0.01 - 0.05 MAF range in order to achieve more accurate prediction. SNPs that had low imputation score (&amp;lt; 0.8) were also removed. This led to removal of 16,645 SNPs. Duplicate SNPs were removed (N = 238). By default, LDpred excludes markers with ambiguous effect directions, i.e., A/T and G/C SNPs. The quality control resulted in . SNPs for prediction and validation. Summary statistics were calculated using 71,973 individuals with available avMSE information. 3. One of the strategies to predict avMSE was LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) from plink software. First, heritability was calculated to be 0.38 with GCTA-GREML method [].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;3.1.5. The models used to test for GxE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following describes the models used to run main GWAS and GxE interaction. To account for population structure that exists between participants from different regions, in all cases first 10 principal components were used in a statistical model. The main genetic effects have been studied using the following linear regression model: ???????? = ???? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????? (x) where ???????? is the spherical equivalent refractive error of the ith participant, m is the population mean, ???????? is sex, ???????? is age, ???????? is university education, ???????? is genotyping platform array, ???????? is a vector of 10 principal components, ???????? is the allele dosage on the scale 0-2 for the test SNP and ???????? is the error term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;heritability-estimation&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;3.1.6. Heritability estimation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After performing analyses with continuous average MSE, a decision was made to explore MSE from case-control viewpoint. Heritability analysis was performed to decide which case-control threshold should be used for performing interaction analysis. A selection was based on the amount of variance explained, standard errors and prevalence. If a particular threshold explained high proportion of variance but had large standard errors, a threshold with smaller standard errors was preferred. In general, higher variance and prevalence were assumed to give more accurate underlying genetic architecture. In addition, phenotype thresholds were selected based on observed liability scale. A range of thresholds were investigated, starting with 0 D and reaching -6 D with 0.25 D intervals. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML. For estimation, a random sample of 45,000 individuals with non-missing EduYearsHigh variable was selected. High confidence SNPs (LD-pruned set of variants with –indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1, IMPUTE2 INFO metric &amp;gt; 0.9, MAF &amp;gt; 0.005, missing rate ??? 0.01, and ‘rs’ variant ID prefix) were used to create a genetic relationship matrix for this subset of randomly sampled individuals. Ideally, disease prevalence should be specified using population prevalence but since this information for each threshold is not available, prevalence was specified using 71,973 UK Biobank individuals with EduYearsHigh information. Were needed, p-values were calculated as proposed in Lin, 1989?. As for other covariates, first 10 principal components and age were included as quantitative covariates, genotyping array and sex were included as discrete covariates. EduYearsHigh was included as environmental variable. Main effect was treated as fixed and the GxE interaction was treated as random effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;.1.7. Cross-validation using predicted avMSE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-stage methods have been shown to be more robust at detecting interactions on a genome-wide scale compared to standard linear or logistic regression that surveys all SNPs passing quality control. The problem is that the ideal second stage selection threshold is not defined in the literature. Stringent thresholds will miss GxE and GxG effects for SNPs that have very small main genetic effects. Setting the threshold to 0.05 or close to nominal p-value will lead to an increased number of false positive SNPs for interaction testing. To decide what threshold is the most suitable, 6-fold cross validation was performed. A sample of ~160K unrelated individuals with predicted averaged mean spherical equivalent between the two eyes data was randomly split into 6 groups, each with 26,700 individuals. For each group, a GWAS including a GxE interaction term was performed. The GxE results were meta-analysed 6 times, each time leaving one group out and the left-out group was used for replication. Inverse variance based meta-analysis was performed with METAL (Willer et al, 2010). Before determining how many SNPs replicate, SNPs passing a certain threshold were LD clumped. LD threshold for clumping was set to 0.1 and physical distance threshold for clumping was set to 1000kb. We reasoned that higher selection thresholds were unreliable because in some cases no SNP or just 1 SNP was remaining after LD clumping. Using 1 replicated SNP to calculate FDR is inaccurate since FDR can change dramatically from 0 to 1. Therefore, a decision was made to select a threshold that gave mean FDR of 0.8, which corresponded to -log(p) = 5.45.&lt;/p&gt;
