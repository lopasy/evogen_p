# Abstract

The investigation of gene-environment and gene-gene interaction effects is a natural extension to genome-wide analysis. Given the fact that both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to contribute to development of myopia, the goal of the PhD was to look at the interplay between the two factors to discover novel gene-environment and gene-gene interactions. In Chapter 1 I give an introduction to myopia, focusing on definition, classification, world-wide prevalence, current treatment methods and causes. Chapter 2 introduces reader with the theory of interactions. A detailed description on methods for interaction investigation is given. Chapter 3 outlines analysis of GxE and Chapter 4 is dedicated to GxG. Finally, Chapter 5 provides a conclusion and implications.

# Description of the UK Biobank cohort

The UK Biobank (Sudlow et al., 2015) recruited approximately 500,000 individuals, mostly aged 37 to 73 years old. The information collected included questionnaire-responses about education, lifestyle choices, family history, and diet. At a baseline visit to an assessment centre (of which there were 22 distributed across the UK) participants provided biological samples such as blood and saliva, and underwent a range of cognitive and physical measurements. Approximately 23% of UK Biobank participants underwent an ophthalmic assessment. Refractive error was assessed successfully in 107,452 participants, while age-at-onset of spectacle/contact lens wear was ascertained for 465,050 participants. DNA samples from all the participants were genotyped, using one of two SNP array platforms (N = 438,427 for UK Biobank Axiom and N = 49,950 for UK BiLEVE), phased using SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al., 2013) and imputed to a combined 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (The Genomes Project, 2015) (N=2,504 individuals) and UK10K (Huang et al., 2015) (N=6,285 individuals) reference panels. A detailed description of the official UK Biobank genotyping and quality control methods can be accessed from http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/genotyping_qc.pdf and information regarding haplotype estimation and imputation can be found at http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/impute_ukb_v1.pdf (both links accessed 29 on April 2016). In total, 805,426 SNPs have been directly genotyped and used for imputation, which resulted in over 92 million SNPs available for data analysis.

# 1.	Introduction to myopia

##1.1.	Definition and classification
Myopia (short-sightedness or near-sightedness) is a type of refractive error of the eye and is amongst the most common eye disorders in the world. The WHO recognises myopia as a major cause of visual impairment [Resnikoff et al., 2004]. In healthy patients with clear vision, distant objects are focused on or near photoreceptors, whereas in myopic eyes the image of distant objects falls in front of the photoreceptors [Morgan et al., 2012]. The resulting blurred image cannot be brought into focus by accommodation (the variable power of the lens) causing visual impairment. The primary cause of myopia is disproportionate elongation of the posterior segment of the eye [Wojciechowski, 2011]. This eye length and myopia relationship allows researchers to use axial length measurement as an endophenotype for understanding the biology behind myopia [axial length GWAS]. Although important biologically, refractive error is the clinically meaningful value [Morgan et al., 2012]. On rare occasions, it can result as a consequence of abnormal changes in corneal curvature []. 
Refractive error is quantified as spherical equivalent (SE; spherical refraction plus half the negative cylinder) in diopters (D) [Morgan et al., 2012] and theoretically can range from minus infinity to plus infinity, although in practice the spread is much narrower [see Cook and Glasscock, 1951]. By convention (in most cases?), individuals with SE ???+0.5D are defined as hyperopic, those with SE +0.25D and ???0.25D as emmetropic and myopic if refractive error is ??????0.5D. "Most children are born hyperopic, with a normal distribution of refractive errors. During the first year or two after birth, the distribution narrows, with a mean in the hyperopic range of +1-2 dioptres (D). This change indicates that there is an active process shaping the distribution of refraction, known as emmetropisation" [Morgan et al., 2012]. Having said that, there still remains some ambiguity as to what is the best way to classify myopia. It has been classified by aetiology (simple, hereditary, degenerative), age of onset (juvenile-onset, adult-onset), severity (low, medium, high) and with or without degenerative changes (physiological, pathological), but no well-accepted, well-defined classification of myopia exists []. For example, to define high myopia or pathological myopia thresholds range from ???-5D to -10D [Morgan et al., 2102]. Individuals with -6 refractive error or below are most often considered to be highly myopic and these individuals have increased risk to develop other eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma and chorioretinal abnormalities [Saw et al., 2005]. 

##1.2.	Prevalence distribution
There is unambiguous consensus that the rates of myopia prevalence have increased rapidly over the last few decades, with the most extreme cases seen in East Asian populations [Morgan et al., 2012]. The pattern that emerges from epidemiological studies suggest large variation in prevalence rates in different ethnicities and age groups. It can range from as low as 5% in Australian Aborigines to as high as 84% in Hong Kong and Taiwan [Jobke et al., 2008].
Though the human eye undergoes rapid growth during early childhood--increasing in length from approximately 18 mm at birth to 22-23 mm at three years of age--the variability of refractive error decreases progressively during this period [in Wojciechowski, 2011]. Because the eye grows throughout childhood, myopia generally develops in school-age children and adolescents. About 2% of children aged 5-6 are myopic [Mutti et al., 1996]. Sex differences in whites and East Asians emerge at about 9 years and by late adolescence girls are twice as likely to become myopic (OR 2.03, 95% Credible Interval 1.40-2.93 for whites and OR 2.30, 95% Credible Interval 2.01-2.61 for East Asians) [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. It is estimated that the eye grows 0.5 mm between 10-18 years [Fledelius, 1982] and the incidence of myopia increases sevenfold during this time [Mutti et al., 1996]. Approximately 3-5% of 10-year old white Europeans are myopic [Williams et al., 2008] and up to 20% of 12-13 year olds [Logan et al., 2011]. High myopia affects 10-20% of secondary school children in East Asia [Lin et al., 2004; Morgan et al., 2012]. A meta-analysis by Rudnicka et al., 2016 investigated trends in prevalence of childhood myopia (age group 1-18 years) in 42 different countries. In total, they assessed 374,349 participants, 74,847 of which were considered to be myopic. Sufficient data was only available for whites, East Asians and South Asians. After accounting for age and environmental setting (urban, rural or combined), they observed increase in prevalence per decade only in East Asians (OR 1.23). No variation due to geographic location was observed. There was markedly higher risk of myopia in children from urban environments (OR 2.61, 95% Credible Interval 1.79-3.86). If stratified by country, in all cases but one (whites) an urban environment was associated with increased risk. The same study did not find any differences in myopia prevalence in studies from Europe, USA and Oceania. The highest prevalence was in 18-year old children from Singapore (92%) and about 87% in children from Hong Kong and Taiwan, 72% in China in the same age group. The lowest rates were observed for 5-year old children in rural Mongolia (0.3%) and in general lowest rates in Mongolians from rural areas for all age groups compared to countries analysed were lowest. An interesting observation was made for South Asian migrant children residing in Australia, England or Singapore. They were five times more likely to become myopic than their counterparts living in Nepal or India. At 15 years of age approximately 40% of migrant South Asians are myopic compared with 9% of indigenous South Asians. This supports the notation that migrant refractive error adjusts for new environment []. Data on children of Middle Eastern origin are less comprehensive than data of children of European, south Asian, or east Asian ancestry [Morgan et al., 2012]. In general, the prevalences of myopia are low, but urban-rural differences exist.
With current prevalence rates, what can we infer about the future of myopia? Estimates for year 2025 suggest 324 million individuals will be myopic (95% Credible Interval 276-382 million) [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Others estimate that by 2050. Rapid economic expansion has possibly contributed the most towards myopia increase in East and South Asians and this region is likely to remain the epicentre of myopia increase. This also suggests it is important to monitor trends in other regions expected to experience rapid development [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Overall, the prevalence of myopia seems to depend on where children grow up and the environments to which they are exposed, rather than aspects of genetic ancestry [Morgan et al., 2012].

##1.3.	Treatment-ish
Currently, there is no strategy to completely stop myopia progression, but multiple tools exist to correct refractive error. These can be split into those used to slow down myopia progression or those applied to prevent myopia onset and include lenses, spectacles and refractive surgery. Refractive surgery, in which the corneal surface is flattened and its optical power reduced is now also routine, but is generally not recommended until refractive development has stabilised in the twenties [Morgan et al., 2012].
In addition, evidence suggests that time spent outdoor and time spent performing near-work influence myopia progression. Therefore, some proposed using different correction strategies such as spend more time in schools, or build glass rooms etc. 

##1.4.	Causes
Myopia is considered to be a multifactorial disorder influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Epidemiological observations suggest refraction changes throughout life. Corneal curvature appears to remain relatively stable after age 6, and therefore does not play an important role in juvenile and adult-onset myopia [Zadnik et al., 2003]. Instead, human myopia is largely the result of age-dependent increase in ocular axial length [Fledelius, 1982; Zadnik et al., 2004]. 
Fifty years ago, myopia was believed to be genetic, with only minor environmental influences [Sorsby, 1962] but throughout the years, there has been a rapid shift towards supporting mostly environmental basis for myopia development and progression. One of the clearest insights supporting this idea comes from studies that investigated the relationship between education attainment and myopia. It has been consistently shown that individuals who spend more time in education tend to have more negative refractive error [Au Eong et al., 1993; Shimizu et al., 2003]. Highly correlated factors with education such as socio-economic status (SES), intelligence and near-work are also associated with myopia [Saw et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2002]. Higher SES, increased time reading, and higher IQ have been demonstrated to be associated with myopes. Why? Some researches pointed out that myopia prevalence in some African populations is very low [Jimenez et al., 2012] and this could be attributed to low literacy rates, as most children in investigated countries do not start formal education until ages of 6-8 years. On the other hand, East Asian populations have alarmingly high prevalence rates that could be at least partially explained by strong educational pressures from an early age []. Additional confounding factor is likely to be steady rise in the use of modern electronic devices over the past three decades [Wojciechovski, 2011]. In a cross-sectional investigation of 12 year-old Australian school children, Ip et al. found no significant relationships between myopia and time spent in near work. However, they showed significant associations of myopia with close reading distance and sustained, continuous, reading [Ip et al., 2008]. Studies on the effect of reading on the rate of progression of myopia have provided conflicting results. In a study of Singapore school children, near work was not associated with worsening myopia [Saw et al., 2000]. On the other hand, myopic children in Finland who spent more time reading had faster rates of myopia progression [Parssinen et al., 1989]. Collectively, this favours strong environmental influence on refractive error development. 
As discussed before, urbanization is also indicative of refractive error status [Uzma et al., 2009; Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Potential explanations include a more congested environment [Ip et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010] and greater emphasis on education and hence near vision activities [He et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2015]. Children from urban environments have 2.6 times the odds of myopia compared with those from rural environments [Rudnicka et al., 2016]. Despite the association between myopia prevalence and an urban environment, ethnic differences in myopia prevalence exist among populations drawn from the same living environment []. 
Studies with tree shrew, chick and macaque monkey eyes involving some sort of form-deprivation demonstrated unconstrained eye growth [Sherman et al., 1977; Wallman et al., 1978; Wiesel and Raviola, 1977] and studies with optical defocus via plus-or minus-powered lenses included detectable compensatory changes in eye growth [Graham and Judge, 1999]. This demonstrated that changes in environment could alter normal growth of the eye. Animal studies typically use eyes from early stage of development and whether the results can be extrapolated to adolescent and mature animals remains to be answered [Wojciechowski, 2011 - is it to date?].
More time spent outdoors have been shown to have a positive effect []. Physical activity undertaken whilst outside seems to be unimportant. Moreover, the beneficial effect of outdoor activity appears not to be the result of a concomitant reduction in near work [Wojciechowski, 2011]. Several theories have been proposed to explain protective mechanism (Vitamin D, dopamine levels, circadian genes). Some studies suggest Vitamin D plays a crucial role [], while others suggest it is unimportant []. However, some researchers challenge the idea that light is the only factor and propose greater viewing distance as another contributor (Ian Flitcroft, Dublin). 
One meta-analysis of three British birth cohort studies including over 15,000 white children showed that various familial factors were related to the odds of reduced vision (a proxy for myopia) in childhood including social class, parental education, maternal age and birth order (with higher risk among first-born children) [Rudnicka et al., 2008].
High prevalences and progression rates of myopia have been observed in individuals in visually intensive occupations such as clinical microscopists [McBrien and Adams, 1997], carpet weavers [Simensen and Thorud, 1994] and visual display terminal workers [Tokor, 1988].
Smoking
Plenty of evidence of genetic contribution towards development and progression of myopia exist. Heritability estimates from twin studies across populations are consistently high [Hammond et al., 2001; Wojciechowski et al., 2005], although as with any other trait, the estimates are confounded by shared environment and non-additive effects. 
As a side effect, myopia develops in syndromic refractive errors with known genetic predisposition [Westling et al., 1998]. 
The number of myopic parents has also been associated [Jones et al., 2007; Saw et al., 2006] but relationship might be confounded with shared environmental effect [Wojciechowski, 2011]. 
Both linkage and association studies have reported numerous genes to be associated with myopia (probably not only). 
Genes involved in eye size and refractive regulation have been identified with animal knock-out models [Chen et al., 2010; Schippert et al., 2007]. 
Studies with rare variants
Interactions to date
Searching for gene-environment or gene-gene interactions can be thought of as chasing for a subset of individuals among all those sampled, whom if exposed to particular environment or in presence of certain combination of genetic variants, would show different rates of myopia development and progression. Suppose we could identify individuals who in presence of myopigenic environmental exposure show low levels of decrease in avMSE. Having such information would be useful in making predictions and would therefore lead to more accurate phenotype estimation. Individuals that show high decrease or above average decrease would be advised to restrict exposure. In some cases, it might not be possible or not desirable [example? education]. In other cases, a solution might be fairly easy (see phenylketonuria). Furthermore, studying interactions could lead to discovery of new biological mechanisms which cause abnormal elongation in myopic eyes. For example, it could uncover a pathway that would be otherwise difficult to detect. This could stimulate research on developing treatment either through development of new drugs or by providing insight for conducting genome editing.  It is reasonable to assume that such knowledge would prove to be useful in personalized medicine, since it's goal is to separate patients into different groups and provide tailored treatment to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease [https://acmedsci.ac.uk/download?f=file&i=32644]. Considering GxE and GxG should provide a better understanding of genetic architecture, i.e. what is the effect in presence of multiple factors. This could prove to be useful in studying correlated traits, for instance other refractive errors.  

#	2. Background information on interactions
##	2.1 Introduction to GxE
A natural extension to GWAS analysis is to incorporate interaction effects.

##	2.2. Methods to detect GxE
In recent years, many new methods have been developed to study gene-environment interactions. The simplest type of tests includes exhaustive search methods that screen for interactions across the genome.  Tests for both case-control [] and quantitative [] phenotypes are available. It was shown that when there is gene-environment independence [], case-only test is much more powerful and guards against increased number of false positives if the assumption of independence is met. Some people have suggested to perform interaction analysis only in exposed subset of individuals [] or controls only []. 
In most cases, it is unknown whether there exist gene-environment independence. To address this issue, empirical Bayes [] and Bayesian model averaging [] methods have been proposed. 
A few joint methods have been developed. Kraft et al. proposed 2 degrees of freedom test of main G and GxE for all SNPs. Gauderman et al. later extended this method to include gene-environment correlation for all SNPs.
Next group of tests includes methods that test for GxE only on a subset of SNPs. These multistep tests are motivated by a screen for a subset of potentially interacting variants depending on the relationship between genetic variants, environment and phenotype.  For example, one of the first such tests was proposed by Murcray et al., where the first step screening is based on gene-environment correlation and only those variants that show some correlation are used to test for GxE using case-control analysis. Kooperberg and LeBlanc proposed screening on disease-gene association. Many case-control tests using screening strategy followed, including screening disease-gene association and using empirical Bayes to look for GxE [], screening based on joint test of E-G and D-G association to look for GxE in a case-control analysis [], screening based on E-G association with second stage 2 degree of freedom joint test to test for both G and GxE [], Cocktail analysis of GxE interaction []. A few 2-step methods have been developed to study quantitative phenotypes, including a screen based on Y-G association [], residual variance heterogeneity (rVar) [] and both Y-G association and rVar []. Unlike conventional methods that test for mean differences between genotype groups, the last two methods for GxE look at difference in variance between genotypes. Initially, this was proposed by Pare et al. in 2010 for Y-G association? but this was shown to be incorrect []. The correct way was described in the same paper by screening on residual variance heterogeneity.  In addition, 2 distinct approaches exist to prioritize SNPs for second stage testing:
-	Subset testing
Test only a subset m<< M SNPs that have p < ??_11 from the Step 1 screen, with Step 2 significance level ??/m (i.e. a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs that pass Step 1). Here the analyst must specify ??_1. A larger value of ??_1 will increase the chance of passing a DSL into Step 2, but at the cost of also increasing the number of unassociated SNPs that pass into Step 2. A lower value of ??_1 leads to lower m and thus greater power in Step 2, but at the potential cost of screening out a DSL. The optimal choice of ??_1 depends strongly on M but also on other underlying parameters (e.g. minor allele frequency of a DSL, exposure frequency, magnitude of an interaction, etc.). As a general rule, we have found that setting ??_1 so that between m=25 and m=200 SNPs pass into Step 2 is near optimal for many models. For example, if M=1 million, setting ??_1 to 0.0001 would yield approximately m=100 SNPs to be tested in Step 2.
-	Weighted hypothesis testing
Rather than restrict Step-2 testing to a subset of the SNPs, one can test all M SNPs using a weighted significance level in Step 2 based on the ordered p-values from Step 1 and an initial bin size B. Specifically, the B most significant (lowest p-value) SNPs based on Step 1 are evaluated in Step 2 at significance level (?? /2)/B, the next 2B SNPs are evaluated at (?? /4)/(2B), the next 4B at (?? /8)/(4B), etc. As shown by Ionita-Laza et al., 2007, this guarantees that the overall significance level for the entire procedure does not exceed ??. They recommended setting B to 5. When B=5 the top 5 SNPs from Step 1 are tested in Step 2 at significance level 0.005, the next 10 at 0.00125, etc. Note that with weighted testing the top SNPs from Step 1 are tested at a more liberal (less strict) significance threshold than the standard 5 x 10-8 level required in an exhaustive scan of all M SNPs using standard methods. However, the majority of SNPs will be tested at a significance level that is more stringent than 5x10-8. This indicates the importance of using an efficient Step-1 screening approach with strong likelihood of highly ranking any SNP with a true interaction. As an example, across many simulation scenarios for a disease outcome, we have found the Step-1 screen of the EDGxE method tends to rank true signals higher than the corresponding Step-1 screens of alternative two-step methods.

Set-based tests
Other Bayesian methods
Non-parametric methods - multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR)
The MDR is a non-parametric model-free approach, designed to collapse high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension [Hanh et al., 2003]. The procedure of the algorithm can be described in 6 steps:
	As part of cross validation, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
	2. A set of genetic or environmental factors are selected.
The reduction is accomplished by pooling together genotypes to form a high risk or low risk groups. The performance of this new multilocus genotype is assessed by cross-validation and its significance is evaluated by permutation testing. This method can be used to test for both GxE and GxG. This method allows to investigate higher order interactions although as with any other method, computational demands increase dramatically. Because it is a non-parametric method, no hypothesis concerning the value of any statistical parameter is made and no genetic inheritance model is assumed. MDR has identified interactions in a variety of different real datasets, including sporadic breast cancer [9], essential hypertension [7], type 2 diabetes [10], atrial fibrillation [11], amyloid polyneuropathy [12] and coronary artery calcification [13]. No assumption about the independence or biological relevance of SNPs or any other factor are made, since MDR selects the combination of factors providing the most information.
Bizarre ones
There is also question on which scale should interactions be interpreted -  additive or multiplicative.

##	3.1. Methods

#####	3.1.1. Sample quality control
In total, the UK Biobank consortium released data for 488,377 genotyped individuals. Eight individuals who decided to withdraw their data have been removed. Data analyses were restricted to individuals of European ancestry who did not self-report the following eye disorders: cataracts, "serious eye problems", "eye trauma", or a history of cataract surgery, corneal graft surgery, laser eye surgery, or other eye surgery in the past 4 weeks. Individuals whose hospital records (ICD10 codes) indicated a history of the following were also excluded: cataract surgery, eye surgery, retinal surgery, or retinal detachment surgery. A total of 48,145 samples did not meet these criteria. The white-British subset was created by removing 69,938 individuals from different ancestries leaving 370,286 individuals for analysis. A total of 648 people were described as heterozygosity and missingness outliers by the UK Biobank consortium and so were removed. A total of 283,352 individuals were removed because refractive error was not measured by a doctor (obtain more details on how this was measured maybe). For some of the individuals (N = 240,125) with missing phenotype data, average mean spherical equivalent between the two eyes (avMSE) was predicted using age of spectacles wear information and fitting different age polynomial terms until the optimal number was found. Remaining 86,286 individuals have been tested for relatedness using plink version 1.9 (Chang et al, 2015) and one member of each pair of observed genomic relatedness greater than 0.025 was excluded. The genetic relationship matrix was created using LD-pruned set of well-imputed variants (with IMPUTE2 INFO metric > 0.9, MAF > 0.005, missing rate ??? 0.01, and 'rs' variant ID prefix).  LD-pruning was accomplished by using --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1 command in PLINK version 2 (Chang et al, 2015). This resulted in 72,985 samples that passed quality control (about 15% of the total number of genotyped individuals). In this final subset, no individuals had mismatched inferred and self-reported sex. In some other analyses, the number of individuals included in the models differed slightly depending on how the environmental variable was coded (N = 72,536 when education was used to reflect the age of full time education completion and N = 71,973 was used to represent relative education). No SNPs were excluded based on imputation because variants with MAF > 5% were shown to have fairly high information score (Bycroft et al, 2017). Individuals with predicted MSE were tested for relatedness using the same cut-off value and 160,228 (33%) were retained (unrelated). Likewise, the number of individuals differed slightly (N = 159,158 when education was used to reflect the age of full time education completion and N = 158,761 was used to represent relative education). 

##### 3.1.2.	SNP quality control
All analyses were restricted to genetic variants that had a missing genotype rate < 2% and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium > 10-6. Minor allele frequency was set to > 5%, except in the case of prediction were SNPs with MAF > 1% for better prediction. Only directly genotyped SNPs and those imputed using Haplotype Reference Consortium were considered. In total, about 4.7M SNPs passed quality control stage and were used to discover associations and interaction with true avMSE and predicted avMSE. About 8.5M SNPs were used for predicting MSE.

![Workflow for sample quality control](./Doc1-1.png)


##### 3.1.3.	Education as environmental variable

Education was selected to be an environmental variable for testing gene-environment interactions because previous studies reported one of the strongest correlations between education and avMSE. Three distinct ways of coding education were considered: 
1. Education based on whether an individual has university degree or not as stated by the UK Biobank (this variable was named UniEdu). Those with the degree were coded as 1 and those without as 0 in all analyses.
2. "When environmental variables are measured in a continuous scale, a clearer picture of the interaction can be assessed since the varying patterns of genetic effects responsive to environmental changes can be traced, leading to a better understanding of the genetic heterogeneity under different environmental stimuli (Cen et al, 2015)". Therefore, the effect of education was assessed on a continuous scale (named as EduAgeOLD). Recoding was done based on the age at full time education completion, ranging from 13 to 26 years. For some individuals, this information was not available and in such case, university degree holders were assumed to have completed full time education at the age of 21 years. Individuals who did not have university degree were excluded. In total this resulted in 29,813 individuals assigned with 21 years.
3. The last method considered the shift towards greater education age and university attendance with increasing year-of-birth in UK Biobank. This could add to the difficulty of detecting a SNP x Education interaction (if the effects of education are relative rather than absolute). Hence, a new variable called EduYearsHigh was created. If an individual had an-above average level of education given their year-of-birth and sex, education was coded as 1 and 0 otherwise.

##### 3.1.4.	Creating predicted MSE
Multiple methods have been explored to predict average MSE for individuals without refractive error measurement:
1.	A prediction was made using age of onset of spectacles wear. 
2.	Another method of prediction involved the use of LDpred software. This program calculates genetic risk score factoring Linkage Disequilibrium. A decision was made to include SNPs with 0.01 - 0.05 MAF range in order to achieve more accurate prediction. SNPs that had low imputation score (< 0.8) were also removed. This led to removal of 16,645 SNPs. Duplicate SNPs were removed (N = 238). By default, LDpred excludes markers with ambiguous effect directions, i.e., A/T and G/C SNPs. The quality control resulted in . SNPs for prediction and validation. Summary statistics were calculated using 71,973 individuals with available avMSE information.
3.	One of the strategies to predict avMSE was LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) from plink software. First, heritability was calculated to be 0.38 with GCTA-GREML method []. 

##### 3.1.5.	The models used to test for GxE
The following describes the models used to run main GWAS and GxE interaction. To account for population structure that exists between participants from different regions, in all cases first 10 principal components were used in a statistical model. The main genetic effects have been studied using the following linear regression model: 
     	 ???????? = ???? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ???????????????????????? + ????????                 (x) 
where ???????? is the spherical equivalent refractive error of the ith participant, m is the population mean, ???????? is sex, ???????? is age, ???????? is university education, ???????? is genotyping platform array, ???????? is a vector of 10 principal components, ???????? is the allele dosage on the scale 0-2 for the test SNP and ???????? is the error term. 

###### 3.1.6.	Heritability estimation
After performing analyses with continuous average MSE, a decision was made to explore MSE from case-control viewpoint. Heritability analysis was performed to decide which case-control threshold should be used for performing interaction analysis. A selection was based on the amount of variance explained, standard errors and prevalence. If a particular threshold explained high proportion of variance but had large standard errors, a threshold with smaller standard errors was preferred. In general, higher variance and prevalence were assumed to give more accurate underlying genetic architecture. In addition, phenotype thresholds were selected based on observed liability scale. A range of thresholds were investigated, starting with 0 D and reaching -6 D with 0.25 D intervals. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML. For estimation, a random sample of 45,000 individuals with non-missing EduYearsHigh variable was selected. High confidence SNPs (LD-pruned set of variants with --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.1, IMPUTE2 INFO metric > 0.9, MAF > 0.005, missing rate ??? 0.01, and 'rs' variant ID prefix) were used to create a genetic relationship matrix for this subset of randomly sampled individuals. Ideally, disease prevalence should be specified using population prevalence but since this information for each threshold is not available, prevalence was specified using 71,973 UK Biobank individuals with EduYearsHigh information. Were needed, p-values were calculated as proposed in Lin, 1989?. As for other covariates, first 10 principal components and age were included as quantitative covariates, genotyping array and sex were included as discrete covariates. EduYearsHigh was included as environmental variable. Main effect was treated as fixed and the GxE interaction was treated as random effect.

##### .1.7.	Cross-validation using predicted avMSE
Two-stage methods have been shown to be more robust at detecting interactions on a genome-wide scale compared to standard linear or logistic regression that surveys all SNPs passing quality control. The problem is that the ideal second stage selection threshold is not defined in the literature. Stringent thresholds will miss GxE and GxG effects for SNPs that have very small main genetic effects. Setting the threshold to 0.05 or close to nominal p-value will lead to an increased number of false positive SNPs for interaction testing. To decide what threshold is the most suitable, 6-fold cross validation was performed. A sample of ~160K unrelated individuals with predicted averaged mean spherical equivalent between the two eyes data was randomly split into 6 groups, each with 26,700 individuals. For each group, a GWAS including a GxE interaction term was performed. The GxE results were meta-analysed 6 times, each time leaving one group out and the left-out group was used for replication. Inverse variance based meta-analysis was performed with METAL (Willer et al, 2010). Before determining how many SNPs replicate, SNPs passing a certain threshold were LD clumped. LD threshold for clumping was set to 0.1 and physical distance threshold for clumping was set to 1000kb. We reasoned that higher selection thresholds were unreliable because in some cases no SNP or just 1 SNP was remaining after LD clumping.  Using 1 replicated SNP to calculate FDR is inaccurate since FDR can change dramatically from 0 to 1. Therefore, a decision was made to select a threshold that gave mean FDR of 0.8, which corresponded to -log(p) = 5.45.
