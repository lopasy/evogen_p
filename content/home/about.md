# Biography

During my Master’s degree, I became interested in population genetics so much that in my spare time I end up reading theoretical population genetics papers. While working on my PhD, to keep track of things I do know and don’t know about genetics, I am developing a website/book . My knowledge and interests are not limited to one field but rather extend to other fields of mathematical/computational biology. I did not have a very strong training in mathematics or statistics at the very young age, which is why much of my time is dedicated to understanding fundamental concepts in these fields.
